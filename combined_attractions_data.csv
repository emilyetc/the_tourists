Chicago,"Allstate Arena Rosemont, Illinois","The Allstate Arena is located in Rosemont, Illinois, which is part of the Chicago area. The arena is mostly a sports facility for the Chicago Wolves hockey club, DePaul University men's basketball, and Chicago Rush Arena football team. The exact location of the arena is 6920 North Mannheim Road, which is adjacent to the O'Hare International Airport.Originally the structure was called the Rosemont Horizon. It was supposed to be the home of the WHA Chicago Cougars. Unfortunately the WHA closed before the ground breaking on the arena began in 1977. To fund the arena it was necessary for Rosemont to offer $19 million in bonds. They financed contracts with this money. Araserv, Ringling bros. and MFG International all had exclusive contracts at the arena. In 1979 an accident with construction workers ended five lives and injured 16 others. The incomplete roof collapsed.In 1999 the town no longer wanted to support the arena, so they sold it to the Allstate Insurance Company.

Chicago,"Andersonville Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois","With community roots extending back into the 19th century, Andersonville began when immigrant Swedish farmers started moving northward into what was originally a distant Chicago suburb. During the 1850's, the area north of Foster and east of Clark was a cherry orchard, and families had just begun moving into the outskirts of the city. The first school, Andersonville School, was constructed in 1854, at the corner of the two thoroughfares, and it served as the primary school in the community until 1908.After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, wooden homes and buildings were outlawed in Chicago. The Swedish immigrants who could not afford to construct homes of stone or brick were forced to move to the city's north limits. The immigrants continued to arrive in Andersonville throughout the beginning of the 20th century, and settled into the newly constructed homes around Clark Street. Most of the community was dominated by Swedish businesses, from the delicatessens to hardware stores, shoe stores and blacksmiths and bakeries. Local churches such as Ebenezer Luther Church and St. Gregory's Roman Catholic Church were also built entirely by Swedish immigrants and reflected the religion of the new arrivals.Like many other European-American ethnic groups, the Swedish immigrants began to move to the suburbs during the Great Depression and post-war period, and the neighborhood began to experience decline. With growing concern about the deterioration of commercial situations, the Uptown Clark Street Business Association renewed its commitment to Swedish heritage by renaming itself as the Andersonville Chamber of Commerce. Andersonville was rededicated on October 17th, 1964, with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and Illinois Governor Otto Kerner attending the ceremony. Around the same time, the annual Swedish summer celebration morphed into ""Midsommarfest,'' which has since become one of Chicago's most popular street festivities.During the late 1980's, the Andersonville neighborhood began to experience a period of revival as professionals rediscovered lovely homes and the close proximity to downtown Chicago made it all the more appealing. New stores, gift shops and restaurants opened and Clark Street had a new commercial vitality and diversity.Today, Andersonville contains the largest concentrated areas of Swedish culture in America and is home to a diverse community of residents and businesses. Andersonville is considered to be one of the ""hottest'' neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois and enjoys nationwide fame for its unique commercial district. The locally owned businesses are a crucial part of the vitality and life of the neighborhood, and provide untold economical benefits to the community.Communities all over the America now seek to emulate Andersonville as a model of a thriving and multicultural urban neighborhood. With its rich mixture of ethnicities and history, Andersonville has only grown in popularity over the years and continues to maintain its commitment to preserving its Swedish history and diverse community."
Chicago,Albany Park Neighborhood Part of Colorful Chicago History,"One of Chicago's 77 designated ""community areas'', Albany Park sits in the north central portion of the city and has been dubbed one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the United States.The area that is now Albany Park began with the purchase of 10 acres by entrepreneur Richard Rusk in 1868. Rusk opened a horse racing track there, which attracted city-dwellers to the area. They'd come to enjoy not only the sport but also the country-like setting they found near Rusk's property. The area continued to grow in popularity with city residents and was eventually annexed by the city in 1889, becoming part of Jefferson Township.In 1893, four wealthy and well-known Chicagoans purchased more than 600 acres near the Rusk tract and eventually brought transportation lines to the area. The four men, streetcar entrepreneur DeLancy Louderback, Illinois Trust and Savings Bank founder John Mitchell, Northwestern Elevated Railroad owner Clarence Buckingham, and transportation magnate Charles T. Yerkes, decided to call the area Albany Park, naming it in honor of Louderback's hometown of Albany, NY.The act of bringing public transportation to the area had a huge impact on Albany Park's commercial and residential growth. Streetcars came into the community around 1896 and the Ravenswood Elevated Train had reached Albany Park by 1907. In addition, streets were widened and straightened. This initiated a building boom that included not only numerous new homes but also large department stores, small shops, and entertainment venues, such as theaters. More than 7,000 people lived in Albany Park at the time of the 1910 census. Twenty years later, the community's population had increased more than seven-fold to 55,000.In the early years of the twentieth century, Albany Park became a haven for immigrants hoping to make a home and a living in the city. Germans and Swedes were the first to arrive, followed by large numbers of Russian Jews. Throughout World War II, Chicago's Albany Park was largely known as a Jewish neighborhood, home to numerous synagogues serving the population's religious needs.However, the years after World War II brought declining population to the area as many of the Jewish families moved to the suburbs. Throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s, the community saw a marked decline in property values, and by the mid-70s, many homes and commercial locations stood empty and became dilapidated, attracting drug dealers and other unsavory characters to the area.Finally, in 1978, the city government along with the North River Commission and the Lawrence Avenue Development Corporation intervened in an attempt to revitalize the area. Thanks to its Facade Rebate Program, property values continued to increase throughout the 1980s and 1990s.Today, Albany Park has once again become a popular entry port for immigrants, this time from Asia and Latin America as well as the parts of Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The neighborhood is often referred to as the ""Koreatown'' of Chicago; however, many shops and restaurants featuring a wide variety of other ethnic specialties have sprung up there, especially in the last decade. As a result of the large numbers of immigrants, the Chicago Public Schools estimates that approximately 40 languages are spoken in Albany Park's schools.The community of Albany Park is also well-known for its strong Democratic tendencies. Election results in the 2004 presidential election show nearly 98 percent of the voters in Albany Park precincts casting their vote for the Democratic candidate."
Chicago,The United Center Hosts Chicago Sports and Much More,"Chicago's enormous United Center was the brainchild of William Wirtz, owner of Chicago's NHL franchise Blackhawks, and Jerry Reinsdorf, majority owner and Team Chairman of the NBA Chicago Bulls. In the 1980s, the men sought a new arena for their teams, one that would replace the famous Chicago Stadium, known for its ""roar'' - an incessant noise that accompanied every event that took place there.The men proposed the idea in 1988 and construction on the new arena eventually began in 1992. It opened for business in 1994 and United Airlines purchased the naming rights until 2014 at a cost of $1.8 million per year.The owners of The United Center have proclaimed it to be the largest arena in the U.S. in physical size. (Other arenas, however, have a larger seating capacity.) This center for Chicago hockey and basketball covers approximately 960,000 square-feet and is situated on 46 acres in Chicago's Near West Side community. On the exterior, fans of the old arena say it bears a remarkable resemblance to Chicago Stadium and, acoustically, engineers even tried to recreate the infamous ""roar''. An electronic organ has replaced the old vintage pipe organ that graced the former arena, but it still plays during Blackhawks games, much to the delight of fans.Seating capacity at The United Center varies according to event. It seats 21,711 for basketball games, 20,500 for hockey, and as many as 23,500 for concerts and other events, depending on configuration of the stage.Numerous top-name entertainers have appeared onstage at United Center since its opening in 1994, including The Rolling Stones, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Brittney Spears, Celine Dion, Coldplay, and many others. In addition, the arena has played host to many collegiate sporting events including a number of NCAA tournaments. Family events such as circuses or ice skating shows have also made stops at the arena.United Center is sometimes referred to as ""The House that Jordan Built'' in reference to Bulls star Michael Jordan, who was a member of the team from 1984 to 1999. By far the Bulls most famous team member and often acclaimed as one of the world's best basketball players, Jordan is honored at the United Center with a statue located on the east side of the arena. It stands 17 feet tall from the base to the top of Jordan's head and was cast from 2,000 pounds of bronze. It was unveiled in November 1994 at the time his jersey was retired. The base reads: ""The best there ever was. The best there ever will be.''"

They make their homes in various parts of the zoo, including the flamingo habitat, penguin and seabird house, and the small reptile house.The Pritzker Family Children's Zoo is a North American animal exhibit that allows children to feel ""At Home in the Woods.'' This is not a petting zoo; however, the zoo does offer kids the opportunity to interact with animals at their Farm-in-the Zoo area. Sponsored by John Deere, families that visit this part of Lincoln Park Zoo can come face-to-face with cows, chickens, sheep, and goats, and even participate in milking or feeding.Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo also boasts an impressive Conservation and Research Department, which employs zoologists and other scientists who conduct research to improve animal management and wildlife conservation both inside and outside the zoo.The zoo sponsors a number of events for visitors of all ages including classes, lectures, and demonstrations. During the Christmas holiday season, attendance explodes as Lincoln Park Zoo presents its annual ZooLights, which bathes the entire zoo in twinkling white and colored lights.

Chicago,"The Art Institute In Chicago, Illinois","Fountains outside the Art Institute, Michigan Avenue, ChicagoThe Art Institute of Chicago was founded in 1879, to serve as both an art school and a museum. The school was first located on the corner of State and Monroe Streets, then relocated to its present site of Michigan Avenue and Adams Street in 1893.

Today the museum holds some 5,000 years of art from around the world representing the human expression in art. The school continues to enjoy its reputation of being one of the best art schools in the country.The Art Institute was founded 1879, and named ""The Chicago Academy of Fine Arts''.

There were memorials of two soldiers who were killed in World War I, the George Alexander McKinlock, Jr. Memorial Park in 1924, and the Kenneth Sawyer Goodman Theater in 1925.It was also during this time that the school received generous bequeaths and donations to expand their museums art collection. The holdings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings were significantly enhanced in 1924, by a bequeath from Bertha Honore Palmer.  In 1925, the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection was added. Perhaps the single most comprehensive donation in its history came from Martin A. Ryerson, whose collection contained American and European paintings dating back to the 15th century, textiles, Asian artwork and various prints and drawings.During the 1950's expansion of the museum included, the addition of the B.F. Ferguson Memorial Building. While the 1970's showed a sharp increase in students and tourists who visited the museum.

Chicago,Chicago Midway International Airport - Chicago IL Chicago Midway Flights Airport,"The Chicago area is home to some of the world's busiest airports, and Chicago Midway International Airport is no exception. It has been called the ""world's busiest square mile'' as the eight runways that support the airport are laid out in a square mile formation that looks like a big ""X'' from the air. Although the total airport complex is now bigger than a mile, the square mile was the original land allotment for the airport.Chicago Midway International Airport was the world's busiest airport from 1930 - 1960, or basically right up until O'Hare airport opened to take the strain off of Midway. Unfortunately, O'Hare proved to be too new and attractive to airline firms, who abandoned Midway almost instantly. Briefly out of service, the airport was renovated and low-cost carriers began moving in to the airport.Midway is now known as the low-cost carrier home in Chicago. Southwest has a major presence at the airfield. AirTran is the second largest carrier there. 18 million people fly through annually, mainly on one of the two main carriers.

Chicago,"Garfield Park Conservatory in Chicago, Illinois","The first 40-acre tract of Garfield Park was opened to the public in August of 1874. Originally named Central Park, it was the centerpiece of the West Park System. Wiiliam LeBaron Jenney, designer Garfield Park, was influenced by French parks and boulevards while living and studying in Paris, his influence can be seen and felt in his designs of Westside parks. In 1881, the park was renamed in honor of slain United States President James A. Garfield.Jens Jensen, was hired as the superintendant of the West Park area, his most notable influence in Garfield Park can be seen in the formal flower garden south of Madison Street. Here Jensen combined Prairie-style elements and traditional formal elements. The original intentions for the park were for strolling and picnicking. However, Jensen's engineering expertise led to the development of a large lagoon which served as a means of draining the park site, while in the summer the lagoon was used for boating and in the winter time for ice skating.Recreational features of the park include baseball and soccer field, tennis courts, basket ball courts, a swimming pool, an ice skating rink and play areas for children. The Golden Dome highlights include an Olympic-sized gymnasium, fitness center, boxing ring, theater and gymnastic facility. Visitors can enjoy programs suited to people of all ages and includes picnicking, outdoor concerts and seasonal festivals.In the late 19th century, each of the Westfield Parks had its own conservatory and greenhouse. After being used for 20 years, the conservatories became outdated and obsolete. In 1905, Jens Jensen demolished 3 of the smaller greenhouses in Humboldt, Douglas and Garfield Parks to create a larger, publicly owned conservatory in Garfield Park.Construction began in 1906 and 1907, and the Garfield Park Conservatory was designed by Jensen in collaboration with the architectural firm of Schmidt, Garden and Martin and the New York engineering firm of Hitchings and Co. The structure represented a unique collaboration of architects, engineers, sculptors, artisans and landscape architects.Jensen wanted the Conservatory to be a series of natural-like landscapes under glass, which was an unheard of idea at the time. The strong shape of the structure was designed to resemble the haystacks of the Midwest, complete with the foliage and plants it houses.Today, Garfield Park Conservatory still follows the traditional tenets of Jens Jensen. One of the most popular rooms at the facility is the Palm Room. Here visitors can view 7 dozen different types of Palm trees from more than 2,700 varieties known to exist today. Of particular importance is the Double Coconut Palm, which was grown by conservatory employees in 1959.

Chicago,"Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois","At the turn of the 19th century, the 319 acres that would be designated as Grant Park, was deeded to the commissioners of the Illinois and Michigan Canals. The city of Chicago officially designated the area as ""Lake Park'', on April 29th, 1844. For awhile the area went undeveloped, until 1896, when city began extending the park area over the landfill and lagoon. The Chicago South Park Commission took responsibility for the park and development in 1896. On October 9th, 1901, the park was officially renamed Grant Park, after the United States President Ulysses S. Grant.Because of legal restrictions, there were many building constructed on the grounds of the park. The park was the original site of the baseball diamond where the now Chicago Cubs, used to play. Daniel Burham wanted to develop the land for business purposes; however the move was fought vehemently in lawsuits against the City of Chicago, by Aaron Montgomery Ward. Ward wanted the city to clean up and improve the park area; the one exception Ward made was to allow for the construction of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1892.The Chicago South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers to develop a new design scheme to beautify and improve the park in 1903. The brother's design plans were published in 1907, and included a more formal look designed around French landscaping principals. Further modifications were made to the park and a railway system, landscaped gardens and paths were added.The park continued to expand in the area over landfills and early in the 20th century, the Chicago Tunnel Company did further excavations and the park was formally landscaped by Edward Bennett. In the 1910's and 1920's further landfill expansion allowed the park to become the site for the Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum of Natural History and Shedd Aquarium, both of which were linked together in 1998, by the Museum Campus.Over the years, the park has been the location for many civic and historical events. Visitors have included Pope John Paul the II, and the park was the location for the Chicago Bulls championship celebrations.

Hyde Park is the former name of a Township that included many other neighborhoods that had been annexed by the City of Chicago.Founded by Paul Cornell in the 1850's, Hyde Park is near the Illinois Central Railroad, located south of Chicago. The Hyde Park Township was formed in 1861, and extended from 39th to 63rd Streets. The south border of Hyde Park later extended as far as South 138th Street and west to State Street. The township was annexed to the City of Chicago in 1889, and up until that time had been independent of Chicago.During the 1920's, the University of Chicago lured the Chicago Theological Seminary to relocate to Hyde Park. Since that time, four other theological schools and the Divinity School of the seminary have joined the Hyde Park location, making it home to nearly 50% of Chicago's theological schools.In the 1930's, Hyde Park was a prosperous hotel and resort destination with more than 100 hotels, and a dozen elaborate structures located along the lakefront.

Chicago,"Irving Park, Chicago, History and Community","The Irving Park neighborhood in Chicago is actually made up of a group of many small neighborhoods such as the Triangle, Mayfair and West Walker which are located on the northwest side of the city. Known for its wide variety of historic architecture, abundance of dining and transportation options, Irving Park is popular with young professionals.White collar workers outnumber blue collar workers by 4 to 1.  The average age is close to 35 and there are more than twice as many non-family households as there are family households.  The median household net worth is over $98,000 .Irving Park is home to one of the most well-known Chicago landmarks, the Peoples Gas Irving Park Neighborhood Store.

In addition to community assistance projects, such as the Irving Park Food Pantry, the home owners association is very involved in helping make the community a better place. Called The Old Irving Park Association, the group has several active committees and hosts several social functions each year.While Irving Park is now thriving, it has not been without its hard times. All but one of the original mansions, the Stephen A. Race Mansion, have been demolished. After the Great Chicago fire of 1871, many residents who had lost their homes rebuilt in Irving Park. Irving Park became part of the city of Chicago in 1889 at which time fire service, city water and other city services became available to residents.During the Great Depression, many buildings were converted into rooming houses. When the city decided to cut right through Irving Park to build an expressway, many lost their homes and several businesses closed.The revitalization of the neighborhood began in the 1980's and today the Irving Park Historical Society works to ensure that historic homes and other landmarks are preserved. The list of historic buildings is long, in fact there are hundreds of buildings that were built in the 19th century, but most do not have the type of historical status that prohibits them from being demolished, so each must be fought for on a case by case basis whenever a developer wants to tear one down .Today, an important goal surrounding Irving Park is to preserve its rich history and beautiful architecture for future generations to enjoy."

The neighborhood is made up mostly of middle class working people. This has long been a section of the city that is populated by various city workers and police officers. The neighborhood is named, appropriately enough, after historic Jefferson Park which is located within the district.The seven acre park is used year round by residents of the neighborhood and entire city. There are two baseball fields, a football or soccer field, three tennis courts, a playground, a wading pool for children, and a full sized swimming pool with locker room facilities. There are also miles of walkways for joggers or residents just interested in a stroll through the park.The park also has a field house which is home to several clubs and classes. The teen club and senior center both hold meeting there as do music classes for learners of all ages. There are also several levels of tumbling and gymnastics teams that use the field house. The field house is truly the center of the Jefferson Park neighborhood.The park is named after the nation's third President; Thomas Jefferson. The park commission began acquiring land in 1920 and by 1929 the park was nearly done. The following year the field house was erected and the park still looks very similar to the original version despite the need for occasional updates. One of the most noticeable updates was the addition of three murals painted on the field house over the years. There is a painting of Columbus sighting land, a Viking ship, and of course a portrait of Thomas Jefferson.The homes that surround the park are sold for $500,000 and more; in some cases much more. There are a few million dollar homes sprinkling the neighborhood. This has caused the neighborhood to undergo a change from its working class roots. The neighborhood has stayed affordable to the working class mostly through the efforts of developers.Real estate developers have been buying homes in the neighborhood and tearing them down. After the larger home has been demolished two smaller homes were put on the lot that previously contained one house. According to the Jefferson Park Free Press zoning regulations need to be enforced, or changed to stop this practice because it is leading to overcrowding of the neighborhood. (http://www.jeffersonparkfreepress.com/)The Jefferson Park, neighborhood in Chicago offers the best of city of living combined with a sense of pride in the community and will remain a sought after section of the city to live in."

Chicago,Eclectic Architecture and Abundant Shopping Make the Magnificent Mile in Chicago a Must See,"On a cloudy dayThe Magnificent Mile in Chicago has become one of the biggest shopping areas in the United States with all of the big brand-name stores; it is flocked to by 22 million visitors annually. The ""Mile'' runs from the northern strip of Michigan Avenue below Lake Shore Drive to the Chicago River to the south. The name of the Magnificent Mile is said to have been coined by Arthur Rubloff, real estate developer, when launching his plan for construction and revitalization of the area after World War II.However, many of the architectural sites date from the 1920's.  Between 1920 and 1929, a series of buildings were completed as part of the execution of the ""Paris on the Prairie"" plan, designed by Daniel Burnham in1909. Burnham, who received his big break as an architect after the 1871 Great Chicago Fire and the massive reconstruction effort that ensued, later established himself as the designer of the homes of the wealthy Chicagoans. Though the architectural tastes of Burnham have been questioned by many, by the time of his death in 1912, his architectural firm was the largest in the country. Three years before his death he wrote his proposed plan for the city in essay form, advocating for wide boulevards and fountains, advocating Greek inspired architecture and city support for development.Michigan Avenue was indeed widened into a broad boulevard and the Bascule Bridge, built to connect the Avenue with Pine Street on the opposite bank of the Chicago River, was modeled after the Parisian Ponte Alexandre III. The Ponte Alexandre III is widely considered to be the most opulent and beautiful bridge in Paris. The Chicago Bridge was adorned with nymph and cherub statues and old Europe-inspired, street lamps. The bridge was followed by other large buildings throughout the 1920's as mentioned above.The oldest structure is the gothic-style Old Water Tower which. made of limestone block, managed to survive the Great Fire, dating back to 1869. This landmark which is one of the oldest in the city has become symbolic of the Magnificent Mile in Chicago and of the city itself. In 1969 it was named the first Water Landmark by the American Water Works Association.From the 1970's onwards construction filled out what remained of open spaces on the skyline and this once residential area became the shopping hub that it is today, lined with skyscrapers of diverse architectural styles and periods. One of the last big skyscrapers, the park tower, contains a hotel on the first 30 floors and then upwards fills with 37-floors of residential housing. Single family homes as well as condos and townhouses can be found along the Magnificent Mile and on surrounding blocks.Aside from the scores of shops and half a dozen hotels, diverse restaurants abound and all of the creature comforts are readily available in this busy district of the Windy City."

Millennium Park, ChicagoMillennium Park is a 24.5 acre wonder that sits in downtown Chicago on land that had been owned by Illinois Central Railroad since the 1850's. When Grant Park, which consists of nearly 320 acres, was being built in 1917, it was built around the land owned by the railroad .Once the railroad was no longer in use, the land sat vacant. Many thought that the abandoned railroad tracks and empty parking lots greatly detracted from the beauty of the lake and the surrounding areas, so in 1997 plans were begun to construct an outdoor concert area to cover the eyesore. The next year, the idea for Millennium Park was born .Huge sculptures, the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, an interactive fountain and a garden are just some of the features of the park. Intended as an oasis that all Chicago residents can enjoy, the park includes a welcome center and every concert at the outdoor pavilion is free .There is an outdoor ice skating rink that is open each day and, like many of the park's features, there is no charge to skate.The park's Lurie Garden is a 2.5 acre garden that was designed by Gustafson Guthrie Nichol and named after benefactor Ann Lurie, was honored with a prestigious award in September of 2008.

Chicago,"Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois","The Museum of Science and Industry is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The facility is housed inside the former Palace of Fine Arts from the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The museum was originally endowed by Sears, Roebuck and Company president, Julius Rosenwald, and first opened its doors to the public in 1933, during the Century of Progress Exposition.The Palace of Fine Arts was designed by Charles B. Atwood, and unlike other ""White City'' buildings, the structure was constructed using bricks under the fazade of plaster. After the World's Fair, the site initially housed the Columbian Museum, which eventually evolved into the Field Museum of Natural History. When the new Field Museum was opened near downtown Chicago, the museum organization relocated and the site was vacated.Sears, Roebuck and Company president Julius Rosenwald, and the Commercial Club of Chicago, pledged $3 million toward converting the old Palace of Fine Arts, into a new museum. During the conversion of the building, a new limestone fazade was added and helped the structure retain its 1893 art-beaux look, and the interior was redesigned using a more modern style, by Alfred P. Shaw.The new Museum of Science and Industry opened up to the public in three stages that took place between 1933 and 1940. The first opening ceremony took place during the Century of Progress Exposition in 1933, during the Century of Progress Exposition.The facility has several permanent exhibits on display. The Coal Mine is located inside the museums Central Pavilion and is designed to replicate a coal mine shaft. In 1954, the museum put a U-505 Submarine on display, which was one of only two German submarines captured during World War II.

Chicago,"Navy Pier In Chicago, Illinois","Navy Pier is a 3,000 foot long pier, and was a part of the plan of the City of Chicago, designed by city planner and architect Daniel Burnham and Associates. The pier was constructed in 1916 and cost an estimated $4.5 million to complete.  The structure was originally intended to be used for cargo facility purposes for lake freighters, and there were warehouses built up and down the pier. It was also designed to be a docking space for passenger steamers and due to the location was ideal for public gatherings because of the cooler temperatures in an era that did not have air conditioning.Even while the pier was being constructed, the introduction of cars and trucks was going to have a direct impact on the usability of the pier. The pier became much more popular as a public gathering place then it ever did at being used for the purpose for which it was designed. During World War II, the pier was used for Navy training, and at the time approximately 600,000 sailors and 15,000 pilots used the pier for training purposes. For this reason, the name was changed from Chicago Municipal Pier to Navy Pier.Once the war concluded, Navy Pier fell into the hands of the University of Illinois. During this time, the facility was used as a classroom for training returning veterans in a two-year undergraduate program. However, in 1965 the University of Chicago moved to the Chicago Circle campus, and the pier was no longer used.From the years of 1965 through 1989, the pier area was considered a public eyesore. Nobody and no agency in or around Chicago wanted to pour any funds into the structure. In 1976, the pier began to serve its third function, being used as a public gathering place. The east buildings were reopened as exhibit halls and special events and festivals began to draw people to the area once again. From 1979 through 1987, the US Submarine USS Silversides was docked at the pier.In 1989, the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority took over the pier, and major renovations and construction began in the early 1990's. The pier was rebuilt at a cost of $200 million, and the pier contained kiosks, restaurants, a ballroom, shops, a concert stage, convention hall and a ballroom. Focal points of the restoration include a 150 ft. tall Ferris wheel, an IMAX Theater, the Chicago Children's Museum, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, the Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows and a Bob Newhart statue which sits at the entrance to Navy Pier.If one structure could be chosen to best represent the history and culture of Chicago, it would be Navy Pier. The 79 year old lakefront landmark continues to experience growth and improvements, making it a work in progress. Every year there are more festivals and attractions added to the pier, which is the reason why an average of eight million people per year visit Navy Pier."

Chicago,"O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois","O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, was constructed between 1942 and 1943, and was used as a manufacturing facility for Douglas C-54 aircraft during World War II. The location was chosen because of its close proximity to the city and local transportation. The factory was 2 million square feet and needed easy access to the city of Chicago, as well as the railroad infrastructure. Orchard Place was a small existing community in the vicinity and the airport was originally known as Orchard Place Airport/Douglas Field during the war.The location was the site of the Army Air Force's, 803 Special Depot, which housed many rare or experimental aircraft, including ones captured from the enemies. The historical aircraft would later be transferred to the National Air Museum, and then go on to form the core of the Smithsonian Museum's National Air and Space Collection.When the Douglas Aircraft Company contract ended in 1945, plans were proposed to build commercial aircraft at the factory. In the end however, the company chose to do the production on the west coast. With Douglas departing, the site took the name Orchard Field Airport, and in 1945, the location was chosen by the city, as the location for future aviation demands. The airport was renamed in 1949, after U.S. Lieutenant Commander Edward ""Butch'' O'Hare, a World War II flying ace who received the Congressional Medal of Honor.During the 1950's, Midway International Airport which had served as the primary airport of Chicago since 1931, had become too small and overcrowded for next generation jetliners. It was at this time the City of Chicago and the FAA began developing O'Hare to be used as the main airport of Chicago.In 1955, the first international flights at O'Hare took place, and an international terminal was added in 1958. The arrival of the air traffic from Midway made O'Hare International one of the busiest airports in the world, serving 10 million travelers annually. By 1960, the number doubled, with more people passing through O'Hare International Airport than had passed through Ellis Island in its entire existence.By 1997, more than 70 million passengers had passed through the airport and the number continues to rise each year. The airport is the largest hub for United Airlines and the second largest for American Airlines.O'Hare International had 972,246 aircraft operations and an average of 2,663 per day, in 2005. The airport is the second busiest in the entire world, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. O'Hare has a strong international presence and has flights to more than 60 foreign destinations and was voted the ""best airport in North America'', 10 years in a row by readers of Business Traveler Magazine and Globe Traveler Magazine. Today, O'Hare International Airport still serves as the primary airport for Chicago, Illinois and surrounding communities."
Chicago,"Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago, Illinois","The Chicago Academy of Sciences has been led by natural history lovers, beginning with founder Robert Kennicott, and Museum professionals from the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. During the early years, Kennicott and public citizens assembled collections and welcomed the public to view the natural history artifacts. However, after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the total collection and library were destroyed.In 1894, the collections were rebuilt and the Academy was moved to the Laflin Building in Lincoln Park. It was here natural history was brought to life through innovative dioramas filled with local fauna and flora. Research took flight and flourished, next to wildlife photography and films. By the end of the century, the Academy was considered to be the leading provider of scientific enrichment in the city.Opened in 1999, the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum is a 6.35-acre facility located on Cannon Drive.

Chicago,"Pullman Historic District in Chicago, Illinois","On May 26th, 1880, on the open prairie, the model industrial town of Pullman, Illinois found its beginnings. The town was a tangible expression of an idea born in the mind of George M. Pullman, president of Pullman's Palace Car Company. The Pullman District was the first model of a planned industrial community in the United States and is designated on the National Register of Historic Places.Pullman decided to develop the community, to rival working class neighborhoods elsewhere. Pullman hoped to avoid strikes, attract more skilled workers and as a result attain greater productivity, health, environment and spirit among his employees.The 4,000-acre tract of land selected for the site was located along the west shore of Lake Calumet, approximately 13 miles south of Chicago. The site was essentially open prairie and marsh land linked to Chicago and the south states by the Illinois Central Railroad.Pullman hired Solon S. Berman to be the landscape architect and Nathan F. Barrett, and civil engineer Benzette Williams to translate the plans into a reality. Pullman's Palace Car Company employees were hired to construct the buildings and houses in the Pullman District.The structures of the town were composed of brick, made from clay from Lake Calumet and fired at a brickyard located to the south of town. Pullman stores produced the component parts used in the buildings of the town, and the project was the first of its kind using industrial technology and mass production on a large scale. The Pullman District had more than 1,000 homes and public buildings completed by 1884, less than four years after its inception.Each structure was provided with gas and water, access to sanitation facilities and had abundant sunlight and fresh air. Front and back yards had green space; expansive parks and open land were also featured in the neighborhood. Included in the maintenance of the homes were rental prices and daily trash pickup. Because of these factors, Pullman was voted the world's most perfect town at the Prague International Hygienic and Pharmaceutical Expo in 1896.The Pullman Historic District is a strong community with a devotion to heritage preservation. In 1975, the Pullman Historic Foundation was organized, with the intent of expanding preservation efforts already started and to involve greater resources from the surrounding community.The state of Illinois purchased the Hotel Florence and the Pullman Clock Factory Tower and administration buildings in 1991. With the acquisition of these structures, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency began the development of the Pullman State Historical Site. Extensive preservation and renovations began taking place in 2000, and continues to the present day.The Pullman Historic District benefits from a rich and diverse residential community, with some of the residents coming to Pullman expressly for its historical value. Everyone who lives in the Pullman community appreciates the deep sense of history associated with the neighborhood and works hard to preserve its appeal."
Chicago,"Ravinia Park in Highland Park, Illinois","Ravinia Park is in the suburb of Highland Park, located just outside of Chicago, Illinois. The private park is home to a variety of indoor and outdoor performing arts facilities. The park gets its name from the ravines that run parallel to the park along the shores of Lake Michigan. Every year since 1936, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra has held its summer music performances in Ravinia Park. The months of June through September, the park hosts many different musical performances and concerts, which are popular with residents as well as visitors.Ravinia Park was first opened in 1904 as an amusement park by the A.C. Frost Company. The park was first designed to attract visitors and to get them to use the newly established Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railroad. At the time it was first opened, the park had a baseball diamond, electric fountain and a building with a dining room and dance floor. When the railroad went out of business, the park was in danger of being closed.

Chicago,"Soldier Field - Chicago, Illinois - Home to the NFL's Chicago Bears","Soldier Field, formerly Municipal Grant Park Stadium, is home to the NFL's Chicago Bears. The stadium itself is found in Chicago, Illinois, located close to downtown Chicago and the Museum Campus. As of 2008, it is considered to be the smallest stadium in the NFL. Renamed Soldier Field in 1925, the venue has been host to a variety of events, including the FIFA World Cup and countless concerts with stars such as Bon Jovi, the Grateful Dead, and U2. At one point, Soldier Field was home to the NASCAR Grand National, but this was a onetime only event held in 1956. It was also the site of the Chicago Freedom Movement in 1966, where Dr. Martin Luther King and many other people held a rally for equal rights.The design for Soldier Field was decided in 1919, when Holabird and Roche won an architectural competition to decide upon a structure to honor American soldiers killed in action. Construction began in 1922 with the venue's completion in 1924. It opened in October 1924 on the 53rd anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The first football game held at Soldier Field was between Louisville Male High School and Chicago Austin High School. Soldier Field was built by the South Park Commission. Soldier Field initially cost $10 million to build, but has undergone $600 million in renovations over the last 80+ years. The venue is owned by the Chicago Park District/City of Chicago and is maintained and operated by SMG.Interestingly enough, Soldier Field wasn't home to the Chicago Bears until 1971. With their move to the stadium, the natural grass field was changed to AstroTurf, but was returned to a natural surface again in 1988, and has been that way since. Initially, the open-roofed stadium had a seating capacity of 45,000. Over the years, this grew to its current capacity of 61,000. Still, the largest event held in the venue more than quadrupled this, with 260,000 people attending the 1954 Catholic Church's Marian Year Tribute.Many areas of the venue are available for rent for those looking to host a special event. Soldier Field also offers public as well as private tours for those looking to explore the historical site.Over the years, Soldier Field has undergone a number of changes. Now, patrons can find a number of Chase ATMs throughout the stadium. Soldier Field also offers almost twice as many restrooms as it did before the upgrade, and boasts 14 family restrooms on top of it.The architecture of Soldier Field is modeled after the Greco-Roman tradition with a number of columns.

The stadium also chooses to honor past football legends who played for the Chicago Bears with memorials all about the venue, commemorating the sports heroes. In 1984, the stadium was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Chicago,"The Lincoln Square Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois","The Lincoln Square neighborhood is located on the North side of Chicago, Illinois and was officially designated by its official name by the City of Chicago in 1925. Greater Lincoln Square covers the smaller neighborhoods of Ravenswood Manor, Ravenswood Gardens, Budlong Woods and Bowmanville. The houses in the neighborhood are a mix of small apartment buildings and private homes. The population in the area has historically been German influenced, though now there is a mix of Thai and Middle Eastern culture in the neighborhood as well.In its early days, people were drawn to the area because of its greenery and location away from the more densely populated neighborhoods of Chicago. When the first European settlers arrived in the 1800's, they made their settlements within the forests and prairies outside of the main city. The Chicago Fire of 1871 resulted in more people moving into the area to build wooden homes, because in the city, wood dwellings were prohibited because of fire codes.  As a result, those who could not afford to build homes of brick and stone, moved to areas on the outskirts of the city.In the late 1800's, realtors sensed the area was growing, at which time they bought up large parcels of land for minimal prices. The same realtors and investors then were the financial backers for bringing the ""L'' train into Ravenswood. The train became the most popular form of transportation and it is estimated some 10,000 people rode it on a daily basis. As a result of the train, people began moving into the city at a rapid rate and Lincoln Square experienced a population surge.As the area grew, Lincoln Square drew in record numbers of German immigrants. The neighborhood contains a large number of German businesses such as the Chicago Brauhaus, Merz Apothecary, Lutz International Cafy and Niedersachsen Club. The German influence can still be felt by the businesses, architecture and public art located throughout the neighborhood.In 1978, the City of Chicago began a series of renovations that transformed the area. Traffic was redirected, the old postal building was torn down and a new one was erected, the Chicago Transit Authority modernized and expanded the ""L'' and several parking lots were added.

Chicago,"The Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois","The Sears Tower is a skyscraper in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The building has been the tallest in North America since 1973, surpassing both the former World Trade Center and Empire State Building. The tower was commissioned by the Sears, Roebuck and Company, and was designed by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Khan of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.In 1969, Sears and Roebuck was the largest retailer in the world and had some 350,000 employees on the payroll. Company executives decided to consolidate their numerous employees that were distributed all over Chicago, into one structure on the edge of the Loop neighborhood. The space demands required three million square feet and additional room for growth and expansion in the future. The architects, developers and financiers came together and decided on an imposing 55,000 square foot structure and received approval from the Chicago Aviation Board. The entire construction of the tower was paid out of the pocket of the Sears Company and the final costs were estimated to be around $150 million.Construction of the tower began in August of 1970, with the building reaching its maximum height on May 3rd, 1973. Once it was completed, the structure had 108 stories according to traditional counting standards and according to owners it is 109 stories with the main roof, and 110 with the mechanical penthouse. From the ground to the top floor, the tower measures 1,450.58 feet. The building further increased in height in February of 1982, when two television antennas were added, making its total height 1,730 feet tall.The Sears Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in North America, the first being the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada.  The black bands that appear on the tower are actually louvers which allows for ventilation for service equipment and to hide the belt trusses, which Sears and Roebuck did not want to be visible, like the ones used on the John Hancock Center.The observation deck of the Sears Tower opened on June 22nd, 1974 and is on the 103rd floor of the tower. From this vantage point, visitors can view the plains of Illinois, across Lake Michigan, into Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin on a clear day. The deck is one of the most popular attractions in Chicago and draws some 1.3 million visitors every year.The top of the tower is the highest point in the state of Illinois and the antennas get struck by lightning on average of 650-675 times per year. The design of the tower was favored because the building can easily be expanded onto with extra height if needed. The Sears Tower Observatory is one of the most visited and highest observatories, and one cannot experience and appreciate the skyline of Chicago until it is viewed from this vantage point."

Philadelphia,Christ Church is a Must-See Philadelphia Historic Landmark,"Christ Church is an historic Episcopalian church located in the historic section of Philadelphia, close to Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, and Franklin Court. The second church on that sight built by the early Philadelphia congregation, the current church was erected between 1727 and 1744 and is considered to be one of the finest remaining examples of 18th century ecclesiastic structures. Constructed in the Georgian style, it is an excellent example of colonial craftsmanship.The church was the first Protestant Episcopal Church in the country, which makes it the birthplace of the Episcopal Church in America. The early rectors of the Christ Church congregation also played important roles in the in the history of the U.S. in general. Rector Jacob Duche led the opening prayers at the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Reverend William White was chaplain to both the Continental Congress and the United States Senate during the Revolutionary War. White was also responsible for much of the first American Book of Common Prayer, a manuscript that would remain in use for many decades.Christ Church is a National Historic Landmark. Inside, the approximately 250,000 visitors per year can view an elegant interior with fluted columns and handsome boxed pews. The baptismal font inside the church is the one in which William Penn was baptized in England. It came to the church from All Hallows-by-the-Tower Anglican Church in London.The early congregation at Christ Church was prestigious, including 15 individuals who signed the Declaration of Independence. Guests today can visit their designated pews, including Pew 56 for George Washington and Pew 70 for Benjamin Franklin. Betsy Ross also worshipped here, though she was assigned a lesser pew with an obstructed view of the pulpit. The Second Continental Congress also worshipped here as a group in 1775-76. Franklin was also integral in securing financing for the church's landmark steeple (196 feet) and bells, which were added to the structure in 1754.Guides are available to give escorted tours of the church throughout the day. Tours are free of charge but a donation is requested, which assists with the upkeep of the historic structure. Because the church is still an operating Episcopalian congregation, it closes on occasion to accommodate Sunday services, weddings, and funerals. Pre-registration is suggested for group tours.Christ Church Burial Ground is also an interesting tourist attraction. It is the final resting place for many notable early Philadelphians, including Benjamin Franklin and four other signers of the Declaration of Independence - Francis Hopkinson, Joseph Hewes, George Ross, and Dr. Benjamin Rush.

Philadelphia,Cliveden in Philadelphia is a Notable Revolutionary War Attraction,"Cliveden is a colonial estate that sits in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, an area that was once considered a suburb of the city. The estate was built between 1763 and 1767 by Benjamin Chew, a wealthy Philadelphian who was a loyalist, not a patriot. Chew had served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania before the war, but was imprisoned in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War because of his loyalty to the Crown of England. After the war, he became a patriot and went on to live a life of public service.The Cliveden Estate consists of 6 acres and now sits in the middle of a very busy ethnic neighborhood. During the war, dozens of British soldiers holed up in Cliveden during the Battle of Germantown in October 1777, which was fought on this land. The U.S. army lost that particular battle and more than 1,000 soldiers on both sides were killed or injuring during the fighting of this battle. Visitors to the home can still see the scars on the house, made by musket balls that hit the exterior. Many who died on Chew's property were buried there.Though Benjamin Chew sold the house in 1779, he repurchased it in 1797 and the home stayed in the Chew family until 1972, when the ownership of the property was transferred from the Chews to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Therefore, that same year, the historic home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Trust opened the doors of the historic estate to the public.Today, visitors can spend an afternoon touring the attractive home. Guided tours educate guests about the history and architecture of the home, the background of the Chew family and the many family members who lived there, and about the Battle of Germantown and the role that Cliveden played in that part of the Revolutionary War. Walk-in tours of the facility are offered from April through December. Cliveden is closed to walk-ins from January through March. However, adult groups of 45 people are less can schedule a tour of the home anytime during the year with advance reservations of at least 4 weeks. Special interest tours can be organized according to the interests of the group.

Philadelphia,The Liberty Bell Center is a Philadelphia Must-Do for All Visitors,"The Liberty Bell Center is an historic attraction in Center City Philadelphia that houses the famous Liberty Bell as well as other related attractions. It is situated near most of the city's other great historic sites, including Independence Hall, Franklin Court, Old Christ Church, and the U.S. Constitution Center. It is operated by the United States National Park Service and is part of Independence National Historic Park.The Liberty Bell Center was opened in 2003, providing a safe and secure location for the famed Liberty Bell after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Previous to that time, the bell was located in an unsecured location near the current building. Today, guests must pass through a bag check and metal detector before entering the Liberty Bell Center.The Liberty Bell first rang in the tower of Independence Hall in 1776. Created to commemorate the golden anniversary of Penn's Charter, the bell eventually developed a crack and was deemed un-ringable in 1846. Nonetheless, it had already become a symbol of liberty and shared a close relationship to the Declaration of Independence. Each year, hundreds of thousands of visitors get close to the bell, which weighs about a ton and is made of 70% copper, 25% tin, and small amounts of lead, zinc, arsenic, gold, and silver. It still hangs from what experts say is its original yoke, fashioned from American elm.Upon entering the Liberty Bell Center, guests can view a video presentation about the bell as well as a variety of exhibits that focus on the origins of the bell as well as its role as an icon of freedom in today's world. Guests can hear taped presentations recorded in more than a dozen languages, making the Liberty Bell Center a truly international attraction. At the end of the long building, visitors reach the bell, which is displayed in a glass chamber with an excellent view of Independence Hall in the background. Guests can take turns posing in front of the bell for photographs. Park rangers are on hand both inside and outside the Liberty Bell Center to answer questions about the bell and its history.The Liberty Bell Center and most of the other attractions located inside Independence National Historic Park are open daily year round. There is no admission charge for any of these attractions. Hours are generally extended during the summer months and during Freedom Week (July 1 to 5). While timed tickets are required to visit Independence Hall, tickets are not required to enter the Liberty Bell Center. Visitors should expect, however, to wait in the security line, especially during the very busy summer months when Philadelphia is teeming with tourists. Also, guests may need to wait their turn to take their place beside the bell for photos and should be courteous to others waiting for the same opportunity."
Philadelphia,Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia is a Walk through History,"Often considered to be the nation's oldest intact colonial-era residential street and one of the oldest continually occupied streets in the United States, Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia is a charming, narrow cobblestone thoroughfare that boasts row homes that were built between the early 18th and early 19th centuries. First established in 1702, the street is close to the city's prime historic district and many visitors include it on their tour itinerary of the city. It is also just steps from Betsy Ross's house.The street was formed when two local blacksmiths, John Gilbert and Arthur Wells, gave a portion of their land to create an alleyway that connected the Delaware River to their blacksmithing operations. The street later became a popular place for artisans and craftsmen to reside and most of those individuals both lived and worked in their Elfreth's Alley homes. The street was well known for its diverse population and during the Industrial Revolution it became a favored avenue for immigrants who had arrived in America to work at the many new factories in the city.But by the 20th century, the street was quite run down and slated for bulldozing in order to make room for new and faster highways. However, by the 1930s, an association of concerned citizens was formed and they would ultimately save the historic street from demolition. Now a National Historic Landmark District, Elfreth's Alley currently consists of 32 beautifully refurbished homes, most privately owned.Visitors are welcome to tour Elfreth's Alley at any time, but because the homes are indeed owned by private parties, only the exteriors can be enjoyed by those touring the area. However, the lovingly-restored homes are very attractive and redone according to the colonial architecture of the era in which they were built, making for excellent photo opportunities. Home owners are accustomed to tourist snapping pictures and most are not opposed to the practice.One home, however, has been converted to a museum and visitors can indeed go inside and browse. This home is located at Number 126 and is dubbed the Elfreth's Alley Museum. It was once owned by the alley's namesake, Jeremiah Elfreth, also a blacksmith. Inside the museum, visitors can enjoy either a self-guided or guided tour of the home and all its 18th century furnishings. Also at the museum, visitors can pick up brochures that provide information about the other homes on the block, their history, and the stories of the people who once lived in them. Since Elfreth's Alley was formed in 1702, an estimated 3,000 have lived on the street and their stories are fascinating.It's not unusual to see a Benjamin Franklin impersonator strolling down Elfreth's Alley, interacting with tourists and posing for photos. In addition, the Elfreth's Alley Association and the residents of the street occasionally host special events such as monthly First Friday programs, which highlight 300 years of arts and crafts and include architectural walks and historic tours. Visitors can also catch an occasional concert or other musical event in the alley."
Philadelphia,City Hall in Philadelphia is a Second Empire Masterpiece,"Situated in the area known as Penn Square (sometimes Center Square), Philadelphia's magnificent City Hall is an architectural gem and the centerpiece of the downtown area. The tallest building in the city until Liberty Place was built in the 1980s, this National Historic Landmark stretches 510 feet in the air and is considered be the nation's finest example of French Second Empire architecture.Larger than the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, City Hall in Philadelphia was the most expensive municipal building ever constructed. It took 30 years to build the structure, and by the time it was complete, the Second Empire style of architecture was outdated and many city officials deemed the building hideous. Still, most architectural buffs consider the building to be nothing short of a masterpiece of construction.John McArthur, Jr. became the architect for the project, winning a design contest announced in 1860 by local officials. However, the Civil War put a stop to all construction and the building did not commence until 1871, with the first foundation stone laid a year later. In 1873, famed sculptor Alexander Milne Calder began work on the building's elaborate statuary. The project occupied him for the next 20 years.Constant arguments over funding and other issues stretched out the project and caused large gaps in construction. McArthur died in 1890 and architect John Ord was appointed to take his place. Finally, in June 1901, City Hall was deemed complete and the building commission turned it over to the city though there was still some work to be done on the interior.Today, visitors can enjoy this incredible building both from the inside or the outside. Of particular interest on the exterior is the 510 foot tower that includes a huge clock with four faces and hands weighing in excess of 200 pounds each. The statues on the exterior of the building include four bronze eagles, each weighing 9,000 pounds with a wingspan of 15 feet; four figures including two Native Americans and two Swedish pioneers, all 24 feet tall; and the most famous of all the statues, that of William Penn, which stands atop the building, measuring 37 feet tall and weighing 54,000 pounds. For many years, the city maintained a rule that no building in the city could dwarf the Penn statue, until Mayor Wilson Goode broke the rule in 1987 and allowed Liberty Place One to greatly dwarf city hall, standing 945 feet tall. City officials allow Penn to don various articles of clothing, including hats, when a particular event is occurring, such as a notable sports championship for a city team.At Christmastime, a huge tree is placed in City Hall's courtyard and a variety of other events - concerts, European-style Christmas outdoor markets - are held in the area around the building. During other times of the year, other arts performances are presented and the hall is a prime area for protests of a variety of natures.Visitors can opt for a guided interior tour of City Hall in Philadelphia, offered once a day year round (with some additional times on occasion). Guests can also forego the tour and visit just the tower, which is accessible via an elevator from the 9th floor. Tours are free and last approximately 90 minutes. Timed tower tickets most be secured as the elevator holds only 5 people at one time. Tickets for all tours are available in the City Hall Information Office, Room 121, near the East entrance to the building."

Philadelphia,Franklin Court in Philadelphia Educates Visitors on the Life of Ben Franklin,"Franklin Court is a unique Philadelphia attraction that provides guests with the opportunity to learn fun and interesting facts about early statesman Benjamin Franklin and his family. First opened in 1976 for the city's Bicentennial celebration, the site has been greatly improved throughout the last decade and is now a much more popular attraction with visitors of all ages. It is also slated to soon receive another face lift, according to an announcement by the National Park Service in January 2009.The area that is occupied by Franklin Court was once the Philadelphia home of Franklin, his wife Deborah, and their children. The home was thought to be 3 stories tall with 10 rooms. Unfortunately, it was razed in 1812 but visitors can still view pieces of the home and its interior that have been unearthed, including the foundation, wells, and privy (bathroom) pits. A number of ceramic artifacts are also on display in this part of the outdoor museum.Most children, however, enjoy visiting the unique underground museum that is a fun part of Franklin Court. This area underneath the court includes a number of objects made by Franklin, an avid inventor and entrepreneur. There's a Franklin stove, a novel swim fin, and - the most fascinating offering - Franklin's glass harmonica, for which W.A. Mozart wrote a special piece of music. National Park rangers demonstrate the harmonica periodically. The main part of the underground museum features a bank of phones and a wall full of phone numbers that give visitors access to testimonies about Franklin from some of the greatest minds and personalities of the time, including George Washington, Mozart, and author/poet D.H. Lawrence. Also in this portion of the museum is the opportunity to view an interesting 18 minute film about Franklin's life, including his time spent outside of Philadelphia.Several other buildings surround the courtyard area of Franklin Court. They are traditional-style early Colonial townhouses that have been restored to period splendor. Guests can visit 318 Market Street, where they'll be treated to an architectural exhibit about Franklin's interest in fire-resistant buildings. Also inside this building is a display of Franklin-owned pottery and glassware. Situated next door, at 320 Market Street, is the printing office and bindery. Here, rangers give printing demonstrations and guests can view old printing and binding equipment used by Franklin and his contemporaries. Another townhouse is the restored office of the Aurora and the General Advertiser, papers published by Franklin's grandson.Because Franklin was once the postmaster general, guests can also visit the U.S. Postal Museum, located in another of the renovated homes, and can stop by the Post Office and have their mail hand-stamped by a postal worker with a ""B. Free Franklin'' postmark. This is the only post office in the United States that does not fly a U.S. flag because there was not yet one in existence during Franklin's years as postmaster.Admission to all the attractions at Franklin Court is free and the area is rarely crowded but is full of good photo opportunities."
Philadelphia,The Mutter Museum in Philadelphia is one of the U.S.'s Strangest Museums,"The Mutter Museum, part of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, is a macabre museum that was originally founded to help educate future doctors about anatomy and human medical anomalies. Since its inception in 1858, the museum has become a unique tribute to the mysteries of the medical world and the human body and is favored by visitors who don't mind viewing some of the strangest and most disgusting artifacts ever to be found in a museum.The Mutter Museum, located in Center City Philadelphia, got its start when Dr. Thomas Dent Mütter, retired Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College, presented his personal collection of ""unique anatomic and pathological materials'' to The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Since that time, others have added to the permanent collection, which now numbers more than 20,000 objects. The collection includes photographs, prints, medical illustrations, memorabilia of famous doctors and researchers, and portraits, as well as more tangible objects such as fluid-preserved pathological specimens, dried specimens, skeletal remains, and ancient medical instruments that would frighten today's modern-day hospital patient.Guests visiting the museum will make their way through a variety of rooms and galleries. The first, the Mutter Room, contains a replica of the office of early 20th century Philadelphia physician, Dr. Philip Gordon Kitchen. Visitors can view his desk, examining table, supplies, instruments, and more. Also in the same room is an exhibit outlining the lives of various U.S. presidents and their health issues. In addition, the Mutter Room is home to a 1949-era iron lung and an interesting exhibit on the fight against polio.The Upper Gallery contains a collection of 19th century wax models of skin diseases and skulls and bones that were ravaged by syphilis, a disease that was once treated by dermatologists. Also in this gallery is one of the Mutter Museum's most famous exhibits, The Soap Lady. She is so named because after her burial in a local cemetery, the fat of her body turned to a lye soap-like substance, a phenomenon never before witnessed. The Upper Gallery also houses a collection of 139 skulls, a gangrenous hand, and the compressed ribcage of a woman who was the constant wearer of a corset. Another exhibit tells the history of medical museums in American while yet another describes the development of forensic sciences. A fascinating exhibit just outside the gallery tells the story of co-joined twins through the centuries and includes information on original Siamese Twins, Chang and Eng, whose autopsy was performed at the museum in the late 19th century.The Lower Gallery of the Mutter Museum is divided into four areas: Normal and Abnormal Fetal Development, including a plaster cast of Chang and Eng; Internal Medicine, which includes specimens of heart, lungs, lymphatic and urinary systems and objects such as bladder stones and tumors; Disorders of the Skeletal System, focusing on abnormalities including giants and dwarfism; and the Neurology Section, which contains a series of sliced sections of the human head, made especially for the Mutter Museum in 1910.The museum is open daily year round except on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day. There is a fee to enter. No photographs are allowed to be taken inside the Mutter Museum, which is easily reachable on foot from most of the historic areas or can be accessed via Philadelphia's vast public transportation system."

Philadelphia,The Manayunk Neighborhood of Philadelphia has a Rich Immigrant History,"Manayunk is a neighborhood situated in the northwest section of the city of Philadelphia. Once its own entity, it has been considered part of Philadelphia since 1854 through a law known as the Act of Consideration. The name of the area comes from the Lenape (Delaware) Indian word ""manaiung'', which means ""river'' or, more literally, ""place to drink.'' William Penn purchased this piece of land from the Lenapes during the 18th century.Manayunk sits near the Schuylkill River, just south of the Wissahickon Creek. The first person to build a home in the area, originally known as Flat Rock, was the son of Richard Levering, the man who had purchased the land from Penn. The town really grew, however, with the construction of a dam, canal, and locks by the Schuylkill Navigation Company. The canal provided water power for mills and other businesses and once it was in place, the Manayunk neighborhood began to grow in leaps and bounds and soon became a prosperous manufacturing area.During much of the 19th century, Manayunk contributed to Philadelphia's reputation as the leading industrial city in the United States. Immigrants arrived in droves to work at the mills and other plants in the area. They came mostly from England, Ireland, Poland, Italy, and Germany. In addition, many of the city's African-Americans settled in the Manayunk area and were employed in the factories there. The melting pot of residents made Manayunk a very culturally diverse area, a tradition which still continues today and is made evident by the many signs in different languages that line Main Street and other parts of the community.In the 1990s, the hilly neighborhood of Manayunk enjoyed a regentrification of sorts after a decade or more of blight caused by the closure of mills and manufacturing plants. The process of reinvigorating the area began with the opening of some upscale restaurants. More followed and, today, the area is known as an excellent night life location where young adults enjoy bar hopping and visiting nightclubs and comedy venues. A total of about 30 eateries line both sides of Main Street. Aside from new establishments, still present are some of the best small ethnic eateries in the city, started by those same immigrants who arrived more than 100 years ago and carried on through the decades by family members.Shopping in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia is also a favorite pastime. Art galleries and home furnishing stores are quite popular as are boutique-type shops selling unique apparel. The shopping district stays quite busy on weekends, especially during the summer season.In addition, each year the neighborhood residents help to organize the Manayunk Arts Festival, the largest outdoor arts and crafts festival in the Delaware Valley, generally attracting some 250 artists and artisans as well as more than a quarter-of-a-million guests. The art portion of the festival is juried and includes some of the best regional and local artists in the Philadelphia area. This family-oriented event also offers children's activities and sidewalk food offerings presented by local restaurateurs.Manayunk is also know for its ""wall'', an incredibly steep stretch of road that is difficult to navigate in the snow but is an important part of an annual bike race where participants are made to challenge this tough stretch of road."
Philadelphia,The Italian Market in Philadelphia is a Unique Cultural Experience,"The Italian Market is the name given to an approximately six block stretch of 9th Street in South Philadelphia, from Fitzwater to Wharton Streets. A traditional outdoor curb market, the Italian Market - often referred to by locals simply as ""9th Street'' - has long been the site of curbside produce stands and small privately-owned markets that occupy the first floor of many traditional Philadelphia row homes.The history of the Italian Market dates back to the late 19th and early 20th century when the area known as South Philadelphia - which was outside city limits - became a mecca for Italian immigrants. Most arrived in the 1880s and settled at the boardinghouse of Antonio Palumbo, later earning enough money to buy their own homes and open their own retail establishments. Most offered items that would make the new immigrants feel at home, such as homemade pastas and meats, vegetables, and fruit that traditionally accompanied Italian meals. Many of today's vendors are from families that have owned their shops since the early days of the market.Most of what visitors will find at the Italian Market today isn't much different than what could be found there 100 years ago. Proprietors still make fresh pasta on site. Others make homemade Italian sausage or crusty Italian bread and rolls. Some stores sell dozens of varieties of cheeses while others offer traditional Italian baked goods, such as cannoli, biscotti, tiramisu, and much more. Throughout the year, many of the stores peddle their produce or other items outside on tables perched beneath colorful awnings. Large barrels filled with blazing fires keep patrons warm while they shop outdoors during the cold winter months.Many of the shop owners continue to live above their stores, much as they have since the inception of the Italian Market in Philadelphia but some travel into the city each day from the suburbs to tend their stores.In recent years, as the area around the market became more gentrified, restaurants and small bistro-style eateries have popped up throughout the neighborhood, offering sumptuous cuisine with outdoor seating during the warmer months.The ethnic make-up of the neighborhood surrounding the Italian Market, commonly known as Bella Vista, has changed a lot in the last 10-20 years. Today, new immigrants have taken up residence in the area and many of them have opened stores as well. It is not uncommon to see Mexican, Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese businesses interspersed with the Italian-oriented shops. The Mexican shops are especially prevalent and most are tended my Latino immigrants, many of whom have recently arrived in the city.The Italian Market attracts visitors from far and wide. Many suburbanites or former city residents travel to South Philadelphia from around the Greater Delaware Valley area specifically to shop at the Italian Market. The market also plays host each year to the Italian Market Festival, an event that also brings visitors from all over the city and beyond. At the festival, guests can enjoy not only excellent Italian specialties but also ethnic music, dance, and other arts-related performances."
Philadelphia,Franklin Mills Mall is a Shopper's Paradise,"Franklin Mills Mall is a mega indoor shopping mall located in the northeast section of Philadelphia, close to the border of Bensalem and neighboring Bucks County, a northeastern suburb. Situated on a plot of land that was once home to the Liberty Bell Park horse racing track, the mall is one of the largest in the Philadelphia area. Opened in 1989, it is known for its excellent selection of outlet stores as well as traditional mall fare. The mall is owned by the Simon Company, which also owns the area's other largest mall, The Court and Plaza at King of Prussia. It is estimated that this mall welcomes about 18 - 20 million visitors each year.In all, Franklin Mills Mall contains about 200 stores in addition to two large food courts, about half-dozen themed restaurants, and a movie theater with 14 screens. The mall was constructed in the shape of a thunderbolt in a nod to famed colonial resident Benjamin Franklin and his kite and lightning experiment. The logo for the mall is a large red kite. More nods to Franklin can be found throughout the mall including a sculpture of his face in the Grand Court. Other Franklin-oriented or Americana objects can be found at the various color-coded entrances, including a cloud with a lightning bolt, a key with a string, the Liberty Bell, and a bald eagle. Entrances are coded to help patrons remember where they parked in the mall's immense 9,000-space lot.The mall contains 1.7 million square feet in total and is separated into four neighborhoods - red, blue, yellow, and green - each corresponding with one entrance. Additional entrances can be found at the Grand Court and at the AMC theater entrance. Franklin Mills boasts some 20 ""anchor'' stores, five times more anchors than most standard shopping malls.

The mall usually provides group travelers with special perks and coupons for use during their visit."
Philadelphia,The Old City Arts District of Philadelphia is Bucolic Example of Urban Renewal,"The Old City Arts District of Philadelphia is a neighborhood in the downtown area, situated near the Delaware River and just a few blocks from the city's popular historic district. It is generally described as the area between Front Street and Sixth Street to the east and west and Vine St. and Walnut St. on the north and south. It is characterized by charming renovated row homes, cobblestone streets, and a wealth of galleries, restaurants, and nightlife locations.The Old City Art Association refers to this area as ""Hipstoric'', a combination of trendy and historic. Like much of Philadelphia in the 1970s, the area known as Old City had become quite run down, with large numbers of vacant buildings, homes, and businesses, dotting what had once been a grand landscape of beautiful colonial buildings. Warehouses and light industry also gave the area a less than bucolic look. In one of the best urban regentrification programs to happen in the city of Philadelphia, however, this historic area improved bit by bit as residents interested in preserving its historical integrity arrived to purchase dilapidated homes and turn them into showpieces. As a matter of fact, the area was the fastest growing neighborhood in Philadelphia from 1970 to 2000, increasing in population by about 1000 percent. Artists who were looking for cheap studio space quickly grabbed up the warehouses as well, and turned them into studios, galleries, or homes, or all three.The fact that area is also home to seven of the 20 most visited sites in Philadelphia - including Franklin Court, the U.S. Mint, Elfreth's Alley, and Christ Church - have also helped to cement Old City's reputation as a favored neighborhood. Today, interspersed with that history are mom-and-pop shops, boutiques, bistros, coffee shops, and still the occasional machine shop or other light industrial operation.The Old City Arts District, especially after dark, is a favorite destination of young professionals, especially those in their 20s and 30s. An estimated 100 bars and restaurants are located within the neighborhood's boundaries, offering food of a variety of cultures and plenty of live music and dancing, especially on weekend evenings. Some of the city's top-rated restaurants are here, attracting not only city residents but also foodies who come in from the suburbs just to enjoy a fine meal in a vibrant urban atmosphere.Shopping is equally as top-notch in the Old City Arts District. Art lovers will be thrilled with the eclectic collection of galleries here, offering everything from traditional oils and watercolors to cutting edge modern art for the collector of contemporary pieces. Visitors will also find handmade jewelry and other craft-type items designed by some of the city's best artisans. In addition to galleries, visitors will also find clothing stores, gift shops, and much more. Service-oriented establishments are also numerous, including salons, spas, medical buildings, real estate offices, and much more.Homes in the Old City Arts District are quite costly, even those that require some renovation. Generally, they are favored by those who work in Center City and prefer to reach their jobs on foot or via a short elevated train or subway ride."
Philadelphia,Chestnut Street in Philadelphia Provides Great Shopping and More,"Chestnut Street in Philadelphia is an east-west thoroughfare that makes its way through the downtown area, stretching from the riverfront in the east all the way to the western portion of the city. The most notable blocks of Chestnut Street are those that run through the historic area in Center City.Just east of Independence Hall, there are several historic sites situated along Chestnut Street, just one of several streets in the city named after varieties of nuts. The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1824 and 1841, sits at 4th and Chestnut Streets. The beautiful Greek Revival building was designed by architect William Strickland and today contains a collection of portraits of some of the early leaders in the fight for independence. At 3rd and Chestnut is the New Hall Military Museum. Built in 1791, today it houses a collection of artifacts relating to early American military history. Across from that museum is the Philadelphia Marine Museum, which tells the history of shipping on the Delaware River. Yet another military museum, the Army-Navy Museum, is located in the historic Pemberton House. Most notable, however, is Carpenter's Hall, where the First Continental Congress met in 1774. It now houses a museum dedicated to the craft of carpentry.In 1976, the city of Philadelphia turned 12 blocks of Chestnut Street into a pedestrian mall. This was done in time for the July 4th Bicentennial celebration that took place in downtown Philadelphia. The mall would stretch from 6th to 18th Streets and would include expanded sidewalks, pedestrian crosswalks located mid-block, specially designed lighting, bus shelters, planters, and some seating. No cars would be allowed to traverse Chestnut Street for those 12 blocks. The city spent about $7.4 million on the project. The pedestrian mall was a hit for more than 20 years, but auto traffic was restored to the area in the late 1990s due to severe traffic snarls in that portion of downtown.While this part of Chestnut Street is no longer for pedestrians only, it is still a prime shopping area. Situated along this part of the street are numerous stores including both familiar chain apparel stores and boutique shops with unique clothing, accessories, and other items. The street is also lined with other kinds of stores including a few souvenir shops peddling a wide variety of Philly-themed merchandise. There are also quite a few restaurants located along Chestnut Street, particularly in the area that was once the pedestrian mall. Take-out, bistro-type eateries, and formal sit-down restaurants can all be found along Chestnut.After the street stretches past 18th Street, it becomes a typical city street, dotted with a variety of stores, services, hospitals, and businesses, including Liberty Place One and Two, two of the tallest buildings in the city. As it travels further west into the area known as West Philadelphia, Chestnut Street crosses the Schuylkill River and becomes a populous residential street."
Philadelphia,South Street in Philadelphia is a Quirky Entertainment Area,"South Street is an east-west thoroughfare in the city of Philadelphia, running from Front Street at the Delaware River through the downtown area, ending at the Schuylkill River. The most popular and lively part of South Street is located between Front Street and 10th. Parts of this area are also sometimes known as the Headhouse District.The street now labeled as South was originally called Cedar Street and it represented the southernmost boundary of the city of Philadelphia. When neighboring townships were added to the city, the street's name was changed. In the early to mid 20th century, South Street was akin to New York's Garment District and consistently mainly of stores that sold fabric, men's suits, and other similar handmade garments.In the early 1960s, South Street and the garment district were threatened with extinction when a proposed cross-town expressway was to make its way through that portion of the city. Both businesses and residents began moving out and property was cheap, attracting starving artists, musicians, and others looking for affordable housing. Many of the warehouses were turned into studios. The expressway never came to be but the neighborhood remained a haven for artists of all kinds.By the 1970s and 1980s, the South Street of today began to take shape. Numerous small restaurants and night clubs opened and the area became popular with young adults. Bar hopping was a regular pastime and some of Philadelphia's young musical acts got their start in the clubs on South Street, including Robert Hazard. As the years waned, the tourist population took its toll on the residents of the area and most moved out and sold to businesses. Today, the neighborhood is more a tourist attraction than a place to call home.The area is quite popular with local teenagers who like to shop in South Street's quirky stores, but especially young adults, who arrive from other parts of the city and suburbs to enjoy the nightlife just about every day of the week but especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. Some 50 restaurants and bars line the street and the little side streets off South, so there's a huge choice of cuisine. Nighttime means live music at many establishments, featuring a variety of types of music from jazz to ethnic fare.Pieces of the Garment District, now dubbed Fabric Row, still exist, especially around the area of 4th and South Streets. Fabric stores, drapery workrooms, interior decorators, furniture stores, and more can be found in this general area and the prices can be quite good in comparison to similar stores elsewhere.Also along South Street patrons can find nail and hair salons, the occasional art gallery, flower shops, bakeries, electronics stores, coffee shops, and much more, most located on the first floor of buildings that once functioned as residences for earlier Philadelphia residents.But South Street also has its slightly sleazy side. It's not unusual to find the occasional sex shop as well as tattoo parlors and body piercing establishments. For a long time, it was the center of the punk movement in Philadelphia and there are still shops that cater to those who prefer similar styles."

Philadelphia,Philadelphia International Airport - Philadelphia PA Philadelphia Airport Flights,"The Philadelphia International Airport sits in the Delaware Valley, and in 2008 managed to become the 10th busiest airport in the world. The airport runs very close to its projected maximum capacity, with more than 32 million passengers passing through annually. The airport generates more than $14 billion in revenue for the city as well.Feasibility studies are underway for an expansion of the airport, or at the very least an extension of the runways. Currently, the airport is not 100% equipped to handle the new class of super-jumbo jets that will be the preference of many international carriers. As Philadelphia is the hub city for US Airways internationally, this is a major issue. Construction is underway, but it is not keeping up with the rate of expansion and the economic collapse of 2007 - 2009 has everything somewhat tense.The Philadelphia International Airport currently has seven terminal buildings, each with their own lettered concourse. Carriers are clumped - Southwest has it's own area, which is currently being upgraded, while US Airways is merely maintaining its presence as domestic demand softens. International demand remains strong. Philadelphia has benefits from the overloading of JFK and LaGuardia as passengers who dislike delays are more and more often choosing to connect through Philly rather than sweat out a connection in NYC.The airport is also very accessible on the ground for locals and connecting travelers. Taxis charge a flat fare from the airport into the city. Regional rail service connections are available, making the whole Northeast Corridor a possibility. Bus lines run to the airport from all over the city. Additionally, the many universities in the area offer seasonal shuttles to students free of charge and parents can hitch rides without too much trouble on these shuttles at Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter and Spring Break route times."

Philadelphia,"Ringing Rocks Park, a Great Philadelphia Day Trip","Ringing Rock Park on hazy summer dayRinging Rocks Park is a 128 acre property that is located in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania. The property got its unusual name because some of the boulders in the park possess a unique quality: they make a ringing sound when struck.Not all of the boulders make this sound, and the reason that some do while others do not is one of the mysteries of the park. Only one third of the rocks ring while the rest make a noise that most rocks make when struck .The boulders are in a field which is located in the middle of the forest. How the boulders came to rest in the forest is yet another mystery.  The rocks are not uniform and are comprised of a wide variety of shapes and sizes.The boulders cover an area of about seven acres and it looks sort of like a dried up riverbed, but it is not. Some people think that the rocks could have an extraterrestrial origin, but there is nothing to support that type of speculation .While there are some mysteries surrounding the origins of the boulders in Ringing Rocks Park, one thing is certain and that is that people love to visit and bang around looking for ""live'' rocks. Live rocks are the ones that ring when they are hit, while the others are considered dead rocks.The boulders, while the main attraction, are not the only thing that the park has to offer visitors. The waterfalls, one of which is three stories high, freezes in the winter making for an unusual and beautiful sight.Other states boast ringing rocks but, interestingly, the others have a different make up than the Pennsylvania ringing rocks . The impressions on the rocks don't match the typical erosion patterns, which fuels the fire of those who like to blame the boulders on an other-worldly event .Upper Black Eddy is located in Bucks County and is about 60 miles from Philadelphia. Ringing Rock Park makes a great day trip, and you only need to plan on about two hours inside the park. It is an easy hike for most family members, but be sure to wear appropriate shoes. Also, bring your own hammer and your own water.Ringing Rocks Park is a good choice for an unusual trip that even young family members can enjoy."
Philadelphia,"The Liberty Bell And Independence Hall In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Independence Hall, PhiladelphiaThe Liberty Bell has long stood as a symbol of freedom for many people around the United States. On July 8th, 1776, the bell rang out across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the first time. The loud chiming announced the first ever public reading of the Declaration of Independence from Independence Hall.  Through the years, the bell was adopted as a symbol for Native American Indians, suffragists and abolitionists across the United States.The bell was commissioned by the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1751, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of William Penn's, 1701 Charter of Privileges. The bell was cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London England. On the first of September 1752 the bell arrived in Philadelphia. But, the bell was not actually hung until March 10, 1753 with the inscription ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all inhabitants therefore,'' from Leviticus 25:10. Which is still relevant to what our country stands for to this day.There has always been disagreements on how the Liberty Bell got its famous crack. Many believe the crack was caused by a flaw in the casting or the combination of metals used. The first time the bell was rang in July of 1776, caused its first series of cracks. The bell was then recast three times by John Stow and John Dock Pass of Philadelphia in the hope that adding more copper would help sturdy the bell and would improve the tone of the bell. The largest crack on the Liberty Bell that rendered the bell unusable was on the 100th  anniversary of Washington's birthday in 1846.After the Civil War many Americans were looking for a symbol of unity to help heal the nation. The Liberty Bell became one of those symbols to the American people. The bell was tolled upon the deaths of Presidents Hamilton, Adams and Jefferson. In 1852, the bell was removed from the rotting wooden steeple and put on display in Independence Hall. During 1885 through 1915, the Liberty Bell was put on a train and taken to various locations throughout the United States. On January 1, 1976 during the American bicentennial celebration, the bell was moved from Independence Hall and taken to a glass pavilion across the street, this location is now called the Liberty Bell Center.As of 2006, the bell has remained in the Liberty Bell Center, where every year, thousands of tourists gather to ponder this great symbol of American heritage. Every year on July 4th, descendants of the signers of the Declaration of Independence gather to tap the bell, thirteen times in honor of the patriots, of the original thirteen states. Though there is no admission fee to view the bell, strict security measures are taken to protect the bell. The Liberty Bell is still a well known attraction that stands in testament of honor, liberty and freedom for all."

The Wachovia Spectrum was built in the 60's, and will be closing in October 2009. The Wachovia Center on the other hand is fairly new. It is not going to interfere with the Philly Live! Complex. The center was opened in 1996, after two years of construction. It is owned by the same owners of the Spectrum, Comcast Spectator and operated by Global Spectrum. The arena was first named Spectrum II, but naming rights have been sold a few times, until Wachovia got a hold of them.From 2004 to 2008 the Wachovia Center was home to the Philadelphia Soul AFL team. It is still home to the Philadelphia flyers, 76ers, and Wings. The facility was first opened as a home for the NHL Flyers. Since it was large enough to accommodate the other teams it has also been used by them. The construction costs totaled to $210 million.Wachovia has struggled in the subprime mortgage crisis. It struggled so much that Wells Fargo eventually won against Citi Bank to take over the Wachovia banks. The merger has yet to be fully complete, but once the integration is finished the Spectrum will carry the Wells Fargo name. Wells Fargo already has two arenas, one in Arizona and a second in Iowa that carries its name.The indoor arena provides 21,600 seats for basketball and only 19,500 for hockey. There are 126 luxury suites with 1880 club seats at the facility. Also on site are restaurants at the public and private levels for all patrons.

This is after a four day Pearl Jam Concert. The center is to be closed and razed. The proposal is to build a new hotel as part of the Philly Live! Complex.In the early years the sports complex was used for the NHL team and as an Ice Capades facility. In 1968 during one of the ice shows the roof collapsed and the center had to be closed. There was a small battle to get the roof replaced while the Mayor fought with DA Arlen Specter about who should fix the roof. Several All Star Games also made their way to the facility. The Stanley Cup was won at the arena in the 70's. College Basketball Tournaments such as the Big Five games, eight Atlantic Ten Conference Tournaments, and the Final Fours were held at the facility.Wachovia Spectrum had some wrestling tournaments with the WWF and WWE. Many of the performances were live telecasts for the public to enjoy like the Summer Slam, King of the Ring, and Hulk Hogan tournaments. Also, the WCW was promoted at the arena. By far the most prolific of events has been musical artists holding concerts at the arena.The Doors, Greatful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd, Animals in the Flesh, Roger Waters, Us and Them, and Queen have visited the complex. The Who, Guns N' Roses, We Can't Dance, Phil Collins, Genesis, Use Your Illusion Tour, Dio, Kiss, Phish, and Unforgettable Five Tour were other events.

San Antonio,Japanese Tea Gardens in San Antonio,"The Japanese Tea Gardens provides one of the most tranquil and serene attractions in San Antonio, Texas. The garden was originally part of the historic Brackenridge Park that dated back to the 1800's. The idea for a Japanese Garden was conceived by Ray Lambert, a San Antonio City Parks Commissioner. Ray Lambert came up with the idea for a lily pond and eventually the small plot of water became the Japanese Tea Garden. To construct the garden, prison labor was used to shape a quarry and complex, full of stone arch bridges and walking paths. Initially, the Japanese Tea Garden was called The Lily Pond, but by 1915, the city requested that an immigrant from Japan transform the quarry into a Japanese-styled garden.Local San Antonio residents frequent the Japanese Tea Gardens as a place to reflect and meditate. The peaceful and spectacular views of ponds and exotic plants create a perfect environment for a simple stroll. Over time, the garden has received consistent high marks from reviewers who fully appreciate all the beauty that the Japanese Tea Gardens has to offer. The Japanese Tea Gardens are considered San Antonio's best kept secret. A Japanese Pogado that was constructed in the 1920's adds to the cultural element of the garden. Visitors to the garden can learn about its history through numerous plaques that are strategically placed throughout the tea garden. One of the plaques recalls the story of the Japanese family who originally lived in and owned the garden. The original owner, Mr. Kimi Eizo Jingu was eventually displaced during World War II due to prejudice and fear of Japanese citizens. The Jingu family was eventually reunited with the Japanese Tea Gardens but different plaques on bridges near the banks of ponds and entrance all depict the stained history that removed the Japanese family from the gardens they designed. As the years progressed, the Japanese Tea Gardens received less attention from the city and landscapers causing it to deteriorate. The infrastructure was left in disrepair and many of the plants and quarry had dried.The garden underwent renovations and was reopened in March 2008. The garden was closed to complete infrastructure rehabilitations to the facilities. The restored garden features shaded walkways, stone bridges, beautiful flora displays and a 60-foot waterfall. Numerous ponds filled with Koi surround the garden. The garden has returned to its original state as it was first conceived. It is now full of sparkling water and turtles swimming.

San Antonio,Natural Bridge Caverns in San Antonio,"The Natural Bridge Caverns are located seventeen miles north of San Antonio and are the largest stalactite caves in Texas. Stalactites are collected forms of a variety of minerals that are deposited slowly by dripping water. The deposited minerals come together and form a column which eventually looks like the form of ice crystals.  There are more than 10,000 different formations in the chambers of the cave and it has become a large tourist destination for people interested in the outdoors and nature. The cave system is both beautiful and historical and one of the most treasured natural attractions in Texas. Natural Bridge Caverns were discovered in 1960 by four college students from St. Mary's University in San Antonio. The students explored large underground passages that existed under a 60-foot limestone bridge in the area. They made four expeditions to the area before discovering additional rooms and passages throughout the cave. Once the students shared their discovery with the landowners of the Natural Bridge Caverns, the owners decided to share the caverns with the rest of the world. Since that time, the city has worked to preserve the cavern environment and give others the opportunity to explore such a natural treasure.The Natural Bridge Caverns provide educational once-in-a-lifetime experiences for those who visit its formations. Some of the most delicate and rare formations can be found in the chambers of the underground caves. Each chamber is intricately decorated with long soda straw stalactites and cave ribbons. The different sights offer visitors to the chambers so much to do, see, and learn.There is a popular tour that is offered through the Natural Bridge Caverns which is called the Discovery Tour.

The Discovery Tour lasts through a half-mile of the largest show cavern in Texas. Tourists get the chance to take pictures of stones, soda straws, stalactites, stalagmites, and various other formations that they find throughout the Natural Bridge Caverns. The tour does have a fee of $18 for adults and $10 for children ages 3-11. The Discovery Tour lasts slightly over an hour and a half and a tour guide starts a new round every thirty minutes. A modern light system keeps the chambers uniquely lit to enhance the experience of traveling through the chambers.The temperature in the cave hovers around seventy degrees but the humidity is 99%.

San Antonio,"Pecan Valley Golf Club, San Antonio, Texas ? A Texas Golf Treasure, Restored to Its Former Glory","Pecan Valley Golf Club is considered one of golf's treasures, the very same course on which Arnold Palmer missed capturing a PGA Championship in 1968 when a 12-foot putt on the final hole wouldn't go down. The course has also been home to a number of Texas Opens in the late 60s, but over the years it slowly began losing a battle to flooding and neglect.In 1998, however, golf architect Bob Cupp undertook the project to renovate Pecan Valley, and the ""new'' Pecan Valley course has gotten rave reviews. Situated on 200 acres of historic land, the course is a picturesque layout, with huge, native pecan trees and live oaks. In fact, the trees and their long arms are such a hazard that many golfers might find themselves often punching shots out from beneath branches during the course of a round.Salado Creek comes into play frequently as well, winding through the front nine five times and three times on the back nine. The course also features strategically placed bunkers and some dogleg holes that have been known to frustrate golfers.The course, which was once a jungle, is located near the historic Goliad Road, constructed in 1720 by Spanish explorers. There's also a historic marker on the course which celebrates the ""Burnt Oak,'' a 100-foot-tall live oak with a girth of 22 feet.  Estimates place the age of the tree at around 800 years, and it is such a significant landmark that it was once used as a navigational guide.The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 7,010 yards from the longest (Professional) tees, with a USGA rating for that length is 73.9 with a slope rating of 131 on Bermuda Grass fairways and Tifeagle greens. From the Club tees the course plays nearly a thousand yards shorter.Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include the award-winning No. 2. This par-4 plays to 453 yards uphill and it ranks as the most difficult on the course. The real difficulty is on the approach, however, which must carry an elevated green with a false front, making club selection key on this hole.Hole No, 14 is the unofficial signature hole, a par-4 that plays to a length 467 yards from the back tees. The tee shot must carry water to a tree-lined fairway that doglegs right. The lake continues along the right side as players approach a huge green, which is again elevated, calling for precise club selection and accuracy.Since its renovation and re-opening, Pecan Valley has re-established its place in Texas golf. Local media and golf professionals even rated it the #1 upscale golf course in San Antonio, and Hole No. 2 the best in town. Golf Digest also recently ranked Pecan Valley one of the Top 25 Courses in the State.The course also features an enclosed air-conditioned and heated pavilion for events and gatherings."

San Antonio,"San Antonio Zoological Gardens & Aquarium - San Antonio, Texas - large zoo and aquarium","The San Antonio Zoologicial Gardens & Aquarium can trace its history back to the 1800s, but its real birth was in 1914, when Colonel George W. Breckinridge deeded a parcel of land to the city of San Antonio. That land that became the San Antonio Zoo housed a pair of lions, four bears, monkeys, elk, deer and buffalo.In 1929, the San Antonio Zoo made history with two of the country's first cageless exhibits, the Barless Bear Terraces and the Primate Paradise. It was typical of the zoo, which has often been on the forefront in animal management and conservation. In 1948, the San Antonio Zoo added the Richard Friedrich Aquarium to its exhibits, becoming one of the few zoos in the world that featured both land animal exhibits and an aquatic environment. In 1966, the zoo opened the Hixon Bird House, an aviary housing tropical birds in a simulated rain forest setting which allowed them free flight. The San Antonio Zoo now houses one of the largest collections of birds in the world.The Hixon Bird House is still the centerpiece of that bird collection. The building is home to many glass-fronted enclosures with wire mesh roofs open to the elements in order to simulate the natural environment as closely as possible. Each enclosure is a diorama that features an environment as close as possible to the bird's natural home. There are birds from Africa, North and South America and the jungles of Asia. Visitors have a chance to watch the famed roadrunner of the American Southwest, the fairy bluebird of Asia and the quetzal of the South American Rain Forest.From the air to the sea - one of the most popular exhibits at the San Antonio Zoo is the Friedrich Aquarium. With 24 tanks of tropical fish, the Aquarium features such unusual specimens as the chocolate chip starfish, moon jellyfish and venomous lionfish. The Aquarium is also home to an alligator snapping turtle who is estimated to be 40-50 years old.While many zoos feature animals from the Asian, South American and African rainforests, far fewer have displays devoted to the Australian rain forests. Visitors to the San Antonio Zoo can enjoy a stroll through Lory Landing, an Australian rain forest setting where lorikeets fly free. Lorikeets, small cousins to parrots, are gregarious and friendly birds that will happily perch and feed from a cup of nectar held by a guest. The antics and friendliness of the lorikeets make Lory Landing another of the most popular destinations at the zoo.Amazonia and Africa Live! represent two very different continents in very memorable ways. Amazonia, located along the zoo's waterway, is home to 30 species of tropical animals and dozens of species of tropical plants. The highlights of the display include the pygmy marmoset, the smallest of the South American monkeys, and the jaguar and ocelot. Plants include many rare tropical plants that were confiscated from smugglers at the border. Africa Live! is an immersive, interactive exhibit that is a must-see for any visitor to the zoo. The exhibit focuses on the relationship of animal life and its adaptations to the availability of water. It features interpretive guides, interactive learning stations and the unique Nanyuki Market, a model of an actual street market in Africa.The San Antonio Zoo is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 365 days a year.

San Antonio,Spanish Governor's Palace in San Antonio,"Spanish Governor's Palace is considered a national historic landmark.  The stately building was constructed in the eighteen century and was originally built to protect the nearby Alamo mission and a growing colony. Part of the building's historical significance rests in it being the only example of an aristocratic Spanish house that is left in Texas. The building has been praised by numerous historical societies and was once identified as the most beautiful building in San Antonio. Most theories suggest that the Spanish Governor's Palace was constructed in the 1720's and has been used for various reasons over the years. The building is located near both downtown and the San Antonio River Walk. The Spanish Governor's Palace is one story tall and consists of ten grand rooms with very low ceilings and doorways. The walls and doors in the palace are about 2 feet thick and attest to the firm structural integrity of Spanish Colonial buildings constructed during that time. Each room in the palace is decorated with furnishing from the period that depicts the type of upper-class life the aristocrats who owned the palace once lived. The palace also has a cobblestone courtyard that is adorned with a fountain and shaded by trees. The most ornate decoration at the Spanish Governor's Palace is found on a keystone that hangs above the front doors. It is an ornate sculpture of an eagle with a simple version of the coat of arms of King Ferdinand VI of Spain.When the Spanish Governor's Palace was originally built, its main purpose was to protect the Alamo Mission but eventually the palace became the place where the Texas government resided. In 1772, the old palace was established as the capital building in the Texas region for the Spanish province. The palace has also served as a shop, barroom, and even a schoolhouse. Because the building is beautifully simple, it has the ability to convert into multiple spaces. One of the most peculiar aspects of the Spanish Governor's Palace is the recorded ghost sightings that have occurred inside the palace and courtyards. Visitors can attend a ghost tour of the place that tells the story of early Spanish America. The ghost sightings are connected to a small girl who was buried in the interior of the palace's walls.Visitors are permitted to enter the Spanish Governor's Palace for a nominal fee. Adults are charged $2 and children are only charged $1. Tours of the facilities are self-guided. Touring the Spanish Governor's Palace gives visitors a chance to learn about both Spanish and Texas political history. Visitors who desire a more in-depth tour of the palace are encouraged to come on the last Sunday of the month. During this time, a living history group called the La Compania de Cavalleria shares information with visitors about the palace's history.Today, the Spanish Governor's Palace serves as a tribute to Spanish life in the 18th century. Tourists who enter the palace doors feel as if they have taking a step back in time. The property is currently owned by the city of San Antonio in 1928 and maintained as a historical museum."

It features old European masters, American art of the 19th and 20th centuries, a huge Asian collection, and displays of contemporary and Latin American art, while presenting major art exhibitions, cultural activities and educational programs from around the world.In 1935-36, a second World's Fair known as the ""California Pacific International Exposition'' was held here. Many of the buildings at the southern end of the park around the Pan American Plaza were built for this event, adding Southwestern architecture to the mix, including early Aztec and Mexican pueblo structures as well as Art Deco and Arte Moderne styles.For performing arts, the Tony Award-winning Old Globe Theatre was also created for the Fair in 1935. It is now flanked by two other theatrical venues: the intimate Cassius Carter Centre Stage and the outdoor Lowell Davies Festival Theatre. Also located in the park is the Spreckels Organ Pavilion, which features one of the world's largest outdoor pipe organs, a holdover from the original World's Fair. The 1914 organ contains 4,530 pipes and is housed in a vaulted structure with embellished gables.A catalog of all the attractions within Balboa Park could easily fill volumes. Its museums range from art and science to air, space, natural history and anthropology. Its stages offer a full schedule of plays, musicals, concerts, ballet and puppetry. Its lush gardens include an award-winning rose garden, the Japanese Friendship Garden, a desert garden, and the historic Botanical Building. Indeed, Balboa Park was ranked in 2003 among the 24 Best Parks in the World by the Project for Public Places for its unique blend of horticulture, art, history and culture.There are more than a dozen places to eat in the park, from hot dog stands and coffee carts to the award-winning Prado restaurant. Also found here are special attractions, such as the 1910 Balboa Park Carousel, a half-mile-long miniature railroad, a collection of international cottages, and the area's largest arts and crafts community in the Spanish Village Art Center. And there are hiking trails marked with color coded, numbered signs to inform users of distances, difficulty and changes of route direction.Located at 1549 El Prado, San Diego, California 92101, the Balboa Park Visitors Center is open daily from 9:30am to 4:30pm. Center staff and volunteers can provide brochures, maps, audio tours, and information about the park's facilities. They serve more than half a million visitors from all over the world museum every year, directing them to exhibits, special events, recreational activities, free guided tours, gardens, transportation, dining options, and more.The park grounds are open 24 hours a day, and admission is free of charge for all visitors, including the Botanical Building and most gardens. Museum hours vary, as do admission prices.

San Diego,"Belmont Park - San Diego, California - historical and traditional theme park","Belmont Park is a vintage historic amusement park located on the beach in the Mission Bay area of San Diego. Belmont Park opened to the public in 1925 as the Mission Beach Amusement Center. It remained popular through the Thirties and Forties, but fell into disrepair in the latter years of the 1960s. The park closed down in 1976, but was renovated and reopened in the 1990s. The story of Belmont Park is intrinsically connected to the story of its star attraction, both then and now, the Giant Dipper Coaster.The Giant Dipper, a 2,600 foot long wooden coaster, was custom built for the Mission Beach Amusement Center, and was one of the most popular attractions at the park. When Belmont Park closed in 1976, the old roller coaster fell into disrepair and became an eyesore. Eventually, the city pressured the owner of the ride to tear it down. At that point, a group of citizens stepped up to protest and worked to have the Giant Dipper declared a National Landmark and requested to have ownership of the Dipper transferred to the group. Through a series of business arrangements, the Giant Dipper was restored to operating condition and reopened to the public in 1990.The Giant Dipper is one of two attractions that date back to the original Mission Beach Amusement Center. When The Plunge opened in 1925, it was the largest heated salt water pool in the world. It survived the years better than the Giant Dipper, but only marginally. By 1940, the salt water had damaged the filter system and was replaced with fresh water, making it the largest indoor heated pool in Southern California. The pool was closed in 1987 because the structure failed to meet earthquake and fire safety standards. The Plunge reopened in 1988, just two years ahead of the Giant Dipper.The two historic attractions share top billing with a far newer attraction that is making history of its own. In 2005, the Wave House at Belmont Park opened with a pair of simulated surfing attractions and a beachfront that includes kava bars, barbecue pits and meandering boardwalks. The trio of attractions is only the centerpiece of Belmont Park, which also features thrill rides, a midway, a miniature golf course, a mirror maze and a laser maze. The park also includes numerous shopping venues, boardwalk snack stands and restaurants and a boardwalk with sidewalk kiosks of all kinds.Belmont Park is open to the public at 11:00 a.m. throughout the summer. Closing hours vary. Winter hours vary and all hours are subject to change without notice. Admission to the park is free, but rides are an additional cost. All day ride tickets are available for $12.95 and $19.95. The park also offers a number of discounts, promotions and party packages. For more information about hours and rates, guests can contact Belmont Park at 858-488-1549."
San Diego,"Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, California","The Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institute of Oceanography is located on the University of California campus in San Diego. The facility is a public exploration center and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. First located at the Hotel del Coronado, the aquarium was founded in 1903, and named for Ellen Browning Scripps and E.W. Scripps of the pioneering newspaper family.In 1905, the facility was moved to a small laboratory located at the La Jolla Cove. Years later, the association purchased an additional 174 acres at La Jolla Shores and the first permanent structure was built in 1910. The first building devoted solely to an aquarium was built on the Scripps Campus in 1915. An oceanography museum was located inside a nearby structure and the facility contained 19 aquariums, ranging in size from 96 to 228 gallons.The Scripps Aquarium and Museum first opened its doors to the public in 1951, and within a month of opening, boasted a guest book signed by visitors from 48 states. For more than 40 years, the 3-story structure served as headquarters for the institution; however, in 1985 the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation held a fund-raising event and raised $6 million for the construction of a new aquarium. Designed by the firm of JCJ Architecture on land donated by UC San Diego, the Birch Aquarium at Scripps opened its doors in 1992.With annual visits totaling around 400,000, and some 77,000 school children, the aquarium is one of the most popular attractions in California. Sitting on a hilltop with spectacular views of San Diego, the Birch Aquarium features some 5,000 animals representing approximately 380 species. With 64,157 square feet designed around a central lobby, the aquarium features individual entrances to exhibit areas. Display tanks contain 175,000 gallons of seawater displays, with some of the most diverse aquatic wildlife found anywhere.Some of the more popular exhibits include the Hall of Fishes, which has more than 60 tanks featuring of Pacific fishes and invertebrates from the chilly waters of the Pacific Northwest, and the warm waters of Mexico and the Caribbean. The Shark Reef is a 13,000-gallon tank which is home to sharks that inhabit coral reefs, such species found are blacktip reef sharks, brownbanded bamboo sharks and wobbegongs. The Tide Pool Plaza is a touch-tank that showcases three living tide pools. The Tide Pool features windows which provide close-up views of star fish, hermit crabs, lobsters and other animals native to San Diego tide pools.The Birch Aquarium brings the ocean indoors and welcomes guests to experience life under the sea. Devoted to providing ocean science education, the Scripps Aquarium inspires visitors' curiosity and imagination through intricate exhibits and informative displays. Situated on a scenic bluff overlooking the Pacific, the Aquarium is the perfect place to get lost and spend the day discovering the beauty of the ocean and all it holds."
San Diego,Cabrillo National Monument in California is a Lesson in History,"Located just west of the city of San Diego, California's Cabrillo National Monument sits at the tip of the Point Loma Peninsula. Forming a protective barrier at the entrance to the San Diego Bay, the peninsula was once home to a military base known as Fort Rosencrans as well as a number of gun batteries, thanks to its strategic location.No longer a military reserve, the Point Loma Peninsula is now home to a variety of other attractions, including the Cabrillo National Monument, named for European explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, thought to be the first European to set foot on what later became the west coast of the United States. The memorial was established in 1913 and is situated in a location on the peninsula that provides an excellent view of the bay, the Pacific Ocean, downtown San Diego, and even neighboring Mexico.The Old Point Loma Lighthouse, first lit in 1855, is also part of the Cabrillo National Monument. Extinguished in 1891 in favor of a new lighthouse, it has been remodeled to resemble its original appearance and can be enjoyed on a self-guided tour or via one led by an onsite park ranger. Displays about the lighthouse's history are also on hand.Though Cabrillo National Monument is near a busy urban area, there are still plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy on this attractive stretch of land. Hiking on the 2-mile scenic Bayside Trail allows visitors to explore the coastal sage scrub habitat, an endangered ecosystem. An easy trail that can be enjoyed by all, it also provides great views of the area. Bicycling can also be enjoyed along Cabrillo Memorial Drive, which is not generally heavily traveled.During the winter months, specifically December through February, the Point Loma area is a wonderful place for whale watching. This is migration season for gray whales and it's not unusual to catch a glimpse of huge schools of these majestic marine animals. Whale watching boat tours are available on the mainland but it's often possible to see the whales from land near the Cabrillo National Monument.The park has a rocky intertidal area where kids and adults can explore tidepools during certain times of the year, generally the winter months. With an average temperature of 70 degrees year round, exploring here is always a treat and it's rarely too cold to splash in the water.Birdwatching is popular here as well and a number of avid photographers come to the Cabrillo National Monument area and Point Loma to take pictures of the many varieties of birds that make their home here or make a stop on their way elsewhere. The sunsets are also spectacular, so photographers should make it a point to arrive around dusk for some excellent pictures."
San Diego,"Coronado Beach, San Diego, California - San Diego, CA -Big Crowds Visit Biggest Beach on Peninsula Just Outside of Downtown","Coronado Beach, San Diego, California is located on Coronado Island, which can be reached by ferry from the downtown Broadway Pier or by car driving from downtown over the San Diego Bay Bridge. Although it is named an ""Island'' it is actually a peninsula. It can also be reached by Amtrak train as there is a station in the downtown area near the ferry landing.This beach has the largest stretch of sand of all of the San Diego County beaches. From the street, visitors must negotiate several sand dunes prior to reaching the flat stretch that reaches the ocean. The beach runs along Ocean Boulevard starting in the south at Avenida Lunar and ending in the north at the Naval Air Station North Island Gate 5.The beach is on the Ocean side of the island. There are accommodations available right on the beach and nearby. There is also camping just to the south of the beach.One of the hotels located right on the beach, the Hotel del Coronado, is a National Historic Landmark. This building, found right on the beach edge is more than 120 years old and as a seaside resort it has hosted many celebrities and dignitaries when they have visited Coronado Beach.Billy Wilder's 1959 classic comedy ""Some Like it Hot,'' starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, was filmed at the Hotel del Coronado and on this beach.During the winter months of January through March, whale sightings are fairly common from this beach.There is free parking available on the street and in several parking lots. Parking fills up quickly on the weekends in the summer and on holidays so it is best to arrive early if traveling by car.Coronado Beach, San Diego, California has lifeguards on duty year round during daylight hours. There are public restrooms and showers here as well as designated public fire rings.  Many dining options are available in the downtown section of Coronado Island which is right near the beach.At the north end of the beach there is a section where dogs are allowed off their leashes.No alcohol or glass containers of any sort are allowed on this beach.Beachcombers and swimmers should be cautions of stingrays nestled in the sand here. Surfing is popular on the generally low surf that is found here. Surfing is kept to the northern end of the beach.Coronado Beach, San Diego, California can be affected by red tides in the summer months.Several volleyball nets are located along the 1.5 miles of beach here.In order to keep the beach accessible the lifeguards are equipped with 2 seats with inflated tires that resemble balloons making them easy to push over the beach sand.More than 2 million people visit Coronado Island and Coronado Beach every year."
San Diego,"Coronado Bridge - San Diego, California - Award-Winning, Landmark Bridge","At a length of 2.12 miles (11,179 feet), the landmark San Diego-Coronado Bridge is better known locally as the Coronado Bridge. It crosses San Diego Bay, stretching in a sweeping 90-degree arc to join Interstate 5 in San Diego with Route 75 on the Island of Coronado. It features a 4.67 percent grade leading to its highest point at 246 feet, with a vertical clearance of about 200 feet, allowing even the tallest ships to pass beneath it.Construction on this magnificent structure began in 1967 and was completed in August 1969 at a cost of $50 million. The bridge's spans rest on 30 mission-arch shaped concrete piers, supported by clusters of submerged piles, 54 inches in diameter. The piles were driven to depths of up to 100 feet in the bay's floor.In 1970, Coronado Bridge was honored by the American Institute of Steel Construction with its ""Most Beautiful Bridge'' Award of Merit. The bridge's brilliant blue color is intended to blend with the sky and sea, and its specially designed three-foot high railing enables 360-degree panoramic views of the area without sacrificing safety.Coronado Bridge was originally a toll-bridge, charging westbound drivers $1 to make the drive through its specially designed toll plaza in Coronado. Many of the island's 16,000 residents preferred to keep using the old ferry service to cross the bay, but at a dollar a car, San Diego was able to generate some $8 million a year. The tolls were discontinued in 2002, and today traffic passes in both directions for free, averaging some 100,000 vehicles a day.The bridge was originally designed for four lanes of traffic, without sidewalks or bike lanes. Initially, it had five-foot-wide emergency lanes on either side, where cars could park and photos could be taken. However, these were eliminated in 1993. Instead, Caltrans added a ""reversible'' center lane between the inbound and outbound lanes. This additional lane features moveable barriers, so the number of lanes in each direction can be adjusted to two or three according to traffic flow. There is no provision for pedestrians or cyclists.That said, one spectacular event over Coronado Bridge is the Navy-organized Bay Bridge Run / Walk held in May each year. The four-mile course starts in San Diego's historic Gaslamp Quarter downtown, crosses Coronado Bridge, and ends at Coronado's lovely Tidelands Park. The run is certified and sanctioned as a USAT&F road race. Walkers use a separate starting line from runners. Baby strollers, wheelchairs, and guide dogs are permitted, but no skateboards, bikes, or skates are allowed.Coronado Bridge is also part of the route used by the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for an annual cycling event called ""Ride the Bay.'' Some 2,400 participants show up each August to follow a 25-mile non-timed, non-competitive ride through the five cities surrounding the San Diego Bay. The course starts and finishes at Embarcadero Marina Park South, crossing over Coronado Bridge en route to the Bayshore Bikeway.Not everything about the Coronado Bridge is fun and games, however. Over the years since its opening, more than 235 persons have died by leaping over the 34-inch railing that marks the perimeter. As a result, the bridge has been derided as one of the deadliest ""suicide bridges'' in the United States - ranking second only to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.A body falling 200 feet can reach a speed of over 70 miles per hour. Most of the jumpers were killed immediately upon impact with the water, while others sustained devastating injuries and drowned in the bay. Only about a dozen potential suicides have survived the fall. Unlike custodians in Seattle, San Francisco and Santa Barbara, who have established suicide barriers, emergency phones, and 24-hour patrols on high bridges, local government officials have shown no interest in exploring ways to prevent suicides on Coronado Bridge."

San Diego,"Gaslamp Quarter - San Diego, California - Downtown Shopping, Dining and Entertainment","Listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980, the famous Gaslamp Quarter comprises a section of downtown San Diego eight blocks long between Broadway and Harbor Drive and two blocks wide from Fourth to Sixth Avenues. Gathered here are more than 400 retail shops, galleries, restaurants, coffeehouses, clubs, hotels, markets, and more, providing residents and visitors with convenient access to all of the goods and services they could possibly desire.The Gaslamp Quarter has been a focus of San Diego development since 1850. Some of the city's first residences were built here, as was the town's first bank and its first public theater - the 400-seat Horton Grand Hall, still functioning today. In the 1880s, retired lawman Wyatt Earp ran three gambling halls here, as the area attracted gamblers and prostitutes alike. Until the bordellos closed down in 1912, the old red-light district was known as Stingaree, named after a fierce stingray fish found in San Diego Bay.The Gaslamp Quarter retained its character as a neighborhood of ill-repute before and after World War Two. It became home to dozens of tattoo parlors, tawdry bars, pawn shops, locker clubs, peep shows, massage parlors, and adult bookstores. It was a much favored R&R stop for Navy personnel.Then, in 1974, San Diego's leaders and business community decided to rehabilitate the Gaslamp Quarter. The city council put up $100,000 for extensive renovations, starting with restoration of the Buel-Town Company Building, which today houses the Old Spaghetti Factory. Within two years, the entire area was transformed, setting the stage for a vibrant new downtown commercial zone.The noteworthy Gaslamp District Archway was installed at Fifth Avenue and L Street in 1988, featuring neon, incandescent, and fluorescent light fixtures. It still serves as an icon, symbolic of the city's commitment to urban renewal.For shopping, there are now no fewer than 82 outlets offering accessories, apparel, art, autos/ bikes, books / music, crafts, gifts, and hardware.

The waves at Water House flow between 20 and 30 miles per hour and use as much as 100,000 gallons of water per minute. Wave experiences can be entry level or extreme and riders can choose the FlowRider pool or the FlowBarrel waves, the latter offering a more challenging wave.

It includes the sandy section of The Strand north of Mission Beach, the waterfront facilities along Sail Bay and Fiesta Bay, and beautiful Kate O. Sessions Memorial Park.The Pacific Beach community is a microcosm of Southern California's eclectic population, mixing surfers, college students and beach bums with entrepreneurs, professionals, young families and retirees. Its architecture is varied, too, from 1930s-style beachfront cottages to earth-toned condos and modern steel-and-glass office buildings.Much of life here is focused on the beach from which the neighborhood takes it name. Pacific Beach includes eight miles of paved boardwalk with panoramic views of the bays and beach, a popular route for cyclists, walkers, joggers and skaters. In the warm Pacific waters, residents and visitors can enjoy swimming, surfing, and kayaking, virtually year-round. Activities in the sand include volleyball, picnics, Frisbee-tossing, sand sculpting, kite flying, outdoor barbecues and, of course, sunbathing.From the rental shops near Crystal Pier, visitors can obtain surfboards, body boards, rollerblades, and bicycles. Lifeguards are on duty throughout the year. Pets are allowed on the beach between 6am and 9pm, although they must be kept on a leash. Smoking and alcohol consumption are not permitted.The Pacific Beach Town Council provides support for a number of events that make living and visiting here both fun and unique.

Live music from 4pm to 6:30pm ranges from boogie-woogie and blues to salsa, Latin funk, sixties rock tributes, and even a performance by the United States Navy Band.One of the most popular gatherings is the yearly Pacific BeachFest held in October on the boardwalk between Diamond Avenue and Thomas Street. The day-long event features live music, food, fine arts and crafts, windsurfing, and professional skaters demonstrating their skills. There are amusement rides for children, a beach volleyball competition for adults, a merchant sidewalk sale for shoppers, and a huge fireworks display at Crystal Pier to cap the evening.In years past, the non-profit Business Improvement Association has staged an annual Pacific Beach Holiday Parade on Garnet Avenue, but it was cancelled in 2009 due to the ongoing recession. Instead, a gala ""Christmas at Crystal Pier'' was held with music, activities, contests, decorating, tree lighting, and a visit from Santa. The parade is expected to resume when the economy strengthens.The Pacific Beach Business District includes a jumble of surf shops, taco stands, tie-dye clothing stores, craft galleries, and smoke shops in addition to hotels, banks, office buildings, and restaurants. Window shopping is best along Mission Boulevard and on Grand and Garnet Avenues.Access to Pacific Beach is easy and convenient from Interstate 5.

San Diego,"PETCO Park in San Diego, California","PETCO Park is the home of major league baseball team the San Diego Padres. The park is located at 100 Park Boulevard in downtown San Diego, and was constructed to replace Qualcomm Stadium. Groundbreaking for the stadium began in the summer of 2002, and the park is named after PETCO, an animal and pet supplies retailer based out of San Diego, California.The park was constructed at a cost of $450 million, and was designed by the architectural firm of HOK Sport, Antonie Predock (Designer), Spurlock Poirier (Landscaping) and ROMA (urban planning). The park has a seating capacity of 42,445 patrons, and the surface is composed of natural grass. PETCO Park is owned by the City of San Diego (70%), and the San Diego Padres (30%).The stadium was constructed as part of a plan to revitalize the aging areas of downtown San Diego, California. The park was constructed by the San Diego Ball Park Builders, and was funded by in part by the Center City Development Corporation, and the San Diego Redevelopment Agency. The first baseball game ever played at PETCO Park was on March 11th, 2004.PETCO Park stands out amongst other baseball parks built during the same time period; it goes against the ""retro'' theme parks filled with red brick and green seats. The stadium is designed using sandstone and stucco, with exposed steel painted white, and the seats are dark blue. The neutral earth tone colors chosen are meant to be reflective of the San Diego cliffs and beaches, blue for ocean and white for the sails of the boats in the nearby bay.The concourse of the stadium is open to the playing field and other surrounding buildings. Unlike in many other baseball parks in which the batter faces northeast, at PETCO Park, batters face north and guests are treated to beautiful views of the San Diego bay and skyline, as well as Balboa Park located beyond center field. In 2006, the San Diego Union Tribune awarded an Orchid award for its unique design.The stadium has an area called ""Park at the Park,'' which is a grassy berm which slopes just above the outfield fence. The area is open during game time, and allows fans to sit and watch the game for a minimal cost. When there is no game held in the park, the location is open as a free local park for residents in the area.PETCO Park is impressive in every way, combining the latest, modern amenities with breathtaking views of San Diego. The stadium is an architectural beauty that celebrates the ocean, sky, cultural diversity and unique spirit of California. PETCO Park is a wonderful way to spend the day enjoying a ball game in an attractive, comfortable and family friendly park."
San Diego,"Qualcomm Stadium - San Diego, California - Home to the NFL's San Diego Chargers","Qualcomm Stadium, also referred to by fans as ""the Q'' and ""the Murph'', is the home stadium of the NFL's San Diego Chargers and the San Diego State University Aztecs college football team. The stadium is located within five miles of the Aztec's main campus.Originally named San Diego Stadium, the name was changed to Jack Murphy Stadium in 1980 in honor of sportswriter Jack Murphy who pushed for the stadium's construction in the 1960s. This lasted until 1997, when the QUALCOMM Corporation purchased the naming rights for the stadium for $18 million, and will retain the rights until 2017. This money was used to help pay for the expansion and future renovation of the venue. Jack Murphy's memory is still honored by many fans that still refer to the stadium as ""the Murph'' as well as statue of Murphy with his dog standing outside of the stadium.The stadium, initially costing $27.5 million to build, was expanded in 1997 along with the name change. This pushed the seating capacity to 70,561. Qualcomm Stadium is owned and operated by the City of San Diego. With the 1997 expansion, the stadium gained a total of 34 specialty suites and four club lounges. Two new video boards were installed, along with a new practice area. The cost of the expansion totaled $78 million.The venue offers fans 19,240 parking spaces, and can be rented for special or private events. Along with this, ATM machines can be found all about the stadium. On the plaza level are two pro shops that sell Chargers merchandise for fans hoping to support their team. The stadium has a natural grass field with an open roof. Qualcomm Stadium itself is available for rent for special events and occasions.In addition to being home to the Chargers and the Aztecs, Qualcomm Stadium also hosts the NCAA Pacific Life Holiday Bowl and the NCAA Poinsettia Bowl. It has been the site of FIFA professional soccer games, setting an attendance record in June 2008 in a game between Mexico versus Argentina. A number of other games are also scheduled for the future. Qualcomm Stadium serves as a multipurpose complex, hosting countless other events over the years and acting as the home field for the San Diego Padres from 1969 to 2003. Other events include the Season 7 American Idol auditions (2007).Qualcomm Stadium was formerly the home for Major League Baseball's San Diego Padres, but the team relocated to PETCO Park in 2004. Since the Padres move, plans have been in the works to make the venue better fit for an NFL team. Hosting the World Series and the Super Bowl both in 1998, Qualcomm Stadium is the only venue ever to do so. On the former practice field for the Chargers, and event called Concerts on the Green is occasionally held. For a short time, rugby was played on this field, but after it was leased by AEG, an amphitheater was built to allow for a variety of performances. It has a capacity of 12,500, and is the second biggest venue of this sort in San Diego."
San Diego,"San Diego Zoo - San Diego, California - one of the world's largest and most popular zoos","One of the largest and most respected zoos in the world, a visit to the San Diego Zoo is a must for anyone visiting Southern California. The zoo's statistics are truly impressive - over 800 species of animals and over 4,000 individual animals and birds can be seen throughout the zoo's 100 acres of grounds. It is also one of the few zoos in the world that is home to the giant panda.The zoo was founded in 1916 by Dr. Harry Wegeforth who was also responsible for many of its early acquisitions. Wegeforth traveled overseas and would exchange animals from North America for more exotic creatures. Land in Balboa Park was set aside in 1921 and the zoo moved to its permanent location the following year. Over the decades, as the zoo grew in size, it began to place an emphasis on education and conservation; it was also one of the first zoos to use natural enclosures, rather than cages.As you might expect from one of the best zoos in the world, the variety of animals on display is immense. The zoo is divided into several themed areas, such as an African rain forest, an Arctic wilderness and the newest attraction, Elephant Odyssey. The zoo boasts plenty of rare and exotic animals - bearded pigs, clouded leopards, Przewalski's horses and some giant Galapagos tortoises. There are also a sea lion show, a children's zoo and a reptile house - one of the few indoor exhibits.But one of the most popular - and most crowded - attractions is the Panda Research Station. In addition to excellent vantage points from which to view the zoo's four pandas, the facility also houses a discovery center. Visitors can use the interactive exhibits to find out all about these endangered species; there is also a climb-in panda den and the chance to find out what a panda smells and sounds like. The zoo takes their responsibility to the pandas seriously - there is a team of panda experts on the staff and the zoo even grows its own bamboo on the grounds.There are several ways to see the zoo. Guests can walk on a self-guided tour, though it is important to realize that the zoo covers several miles. There are also guided bus tours, which take in most of the park as well as a miniature railway, which gives an overview of Balboa Park. The zoo also offers custom tours for groups, tailored to a particular theme or interest. But the most spectacular view of the animals as well as the beautiful grounds is to be had from the Skyway Aerial Tram, providing a memorable experience for visitors since 1969.The San Diego Zoo is located in the city's Balboa Park, near to downtown. It's open every day, with extended hours during the summer. The facilities are excellent and the zoo offers a program of daily activities and shows. You can even spend the night at the zoo, with its popular sleepover program, including themed sleepovers for Halloween and Mother's Day."
San Diego,"San Diego Air & Space Museum - San Diego, California - California's Official Aerospace Museum","Also know as the Aerospace Museum, the San Diego Air & Space Museum in Balboa Park is California's official air and space museum. It traces the history of flight, from a model of the Montgolfier brothers' 1783 hot air balloon to the exploration of space.The building in which the museum is housed was built by the Ford Motor Company at a cost of $2 million in 1935. Its purpose was to showcase Ford's line of cars and V-8 engine at the 1935~36 California Pacific International Exposition. In June 1980, the historic Ford Building became the museum's home, following an arson fire that destroyed the existing aerospace collection in the Balboa Park Electric Building.In the Theodore Gildred Flight Rotunda, visitors are greeted by the Apollo 9 Command Module. There is also a reproduction of a Sopwith Pup, along with a variety of other aircraft. The adjacent World War I gallery provides an opportunity to learn about such fighter aces as the Red Baron and Eddie Rickenbacker, as well as their vintage aircraft.A permanent exhibit called ""The Golden Age of Flight'' covers aviation advances from 1919 to 1939.

San Diego,"San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum - San Diego, California - Exhibits Aboard the USS Midway","Also known as the USS Midway Museum, the San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum is like a city on the sea, containing some 60 exhibits and 25 restored aircraft. Officially decommissioned in 1992, this Navy aircraft carrier today ranks as the world's most-visited floating ship museum, welcoming some 4.1 million visitors since its opening in June 2004.The USS Midway was constructed during the last 17 months of World War II as the last of the straight-deck aircraft carriers. It first set sail a week after the war ended. With a steel flight deck covering four acres, it was the largest ship in the world until 1955. Each link in its massive anchor chain weighed 130 pounds. Some 3.2 million gallons of ship and aviation fuel could be stored onboard, and the electrical generators could have powered the homes of a million people.During the Midway's 47-year odyssey, it set new standards in naval aviation. From Operation Frostbite in 1946 and conducting V-2 rocket launches in 1947 to rescuing refugees in Operation Frequent Wind in 1975 and serving as the Persian Gulf flagship for Operation Desert Storm in 1991, more than 225,000 Americans participated in the ships operationsToday, visitors can tour the crew's sleeping quarters and see the ship's engine room. They can walk through the massive galley that once served 13,500 meals and ten tons of food per day. Also on exhibit are the Midway's brig, post office, and machine shops.Visitors are welcome in the pilots' ready rooms, the flight control room and the bridge, which towers high above the flight deck with its three elevators capable of lifting 110,000 pounds each. Aircraft on display include the SBD Dauntless dive bomber, a TBM Avenger, the F9F-8P Cougar, an AD Skyraider, the F-4 Phantom, a Huey gunship, an A-6 Intruder, and the F/A-18 Hornet, among others.Docents assist visitors in understanding the various aspects of life aboard the vessel, with personal stories, anecdotes, and statistics. Self-guided audio tours are available, and there are optional flight simulators that recreate the experience of flying a Desert Storm mission or controlling a fighter jet through rolls, spins and somersaults. Not surprisingly, most visitors spend three or four hours aboard the ship.The ""Jet Shop'' is the USS Midway's gift shop, located on the hangar deck where jet engines were once repaired. It offers a range of apparel, books, scale models, mugs and drinkware, toys, games, CDs, DVDs, souvenirs and memorabilia. Right next door, the Fantail Cafy offers patio dining in a casual atmosphere. It features a variety of fresh salads, sandwiches, burgers, beverages, and more, priced in the $6~$11 range. Some of the menu items are prepared by following recipes from the ship's 1945 cook book.

San Diego,San Diego International Airport - San Diego CA San Diego International Airport Flights,"The San Diego International Airport is an airport with a lot of ""ests'' that can be used to describe it. Closest, busiest, smallest all come readily to the fore. All three of these ""ests'' describe the unique features of the airport and also highlight some of the usage challenges of the facility.The first ""est'' is the closest. San Diego is the closest airport to the Mexican border. Tijuana is just under 20 miles away. As a result, while the airport serves a large number of domestic flights, a good portion of international traffic goes south of the border. This proximity to the border has also made the airport home to a large Coast Guard Air installation, and allowed the airport to be rated for seaplanes.The next ""est'' is the busiest. San Diego International Airport is the busiest single runway airport in America, and the second busiest in the world. In this world of mega-everything, the airport has stuck to just one runway, and does an east-west take-off and landing pattern that reverses with the wind. Naturally, the airport also takes pains to be very safe, as any trouble on the runway would gum up the whole system.Finally, the last ""est'' is the smallest. The San Diego airport has the smallest physical footprint of large commercial airport in the US, sitting on just 661 acres. More than 18 million passengers go through the area each year, and the tiny foot print means landing are exceptionally steep - the planes only clear the parking garage by an average of 109 feet, making the airport a very close presence for many travelers.Mass transit, buses and straight driving are all options for getting to the airport. During busy travel times, extra time for security should be allowed. Flights leave between 6:30 am and 11:30 pm to align with resident noise curfews, though, so there is no need to rush to the airport extra early in the morning as there are not flights departing."
San Diego,"San Diego Maritime Museum - San Diego, California - Collection of Historic Ships and Submarines","Some 180,000 visitors a year come to the Maritime Museum of San Diego to see how sailing vessels are restored, maintained and operated. The museum possesses one of the finest collections of historic ships in the world, including the oldest active ship on the seas - the barque ""Star of India,'' built in 1863.Also known as the San Diego Maritime Museum, this facility was originally founded in 1948 to display both permanent and temporary exhibits related to maritime history, commerce and exploration. Apart from the Star of India, acquired in 1927, the museum features the steam-driven 1898 ""Berkeley'' and the 1904 ""Medea.'' The former was the West Coast's first successful propeller-driven steam ferry, later declared a state and national historic landmark. The latter represents the steam yachts built during ""the age of conspicuous wealth.''There is a replica of an 18th-century Royal Navy frigate on display, the HMS Surprise, which appeared in an award-winning film, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.'' Another fine ship on exhibit is the ""Pilot.'' Built in 1914, it is the oldest pilot boat still in service on the West Coast. Also kept here are two submarines: 1968's USS Dolphin with the record for the Navy's deepest dive and a 1967 B-39 Soviet attack submarine, which was designed during the Cold War to track U.S. and NATO warships.Among the museum's permanent exhibits are five interactive displays: Age of Sail, Age of Steam, San Diego's Navy, Charting the Sea - Ocean Exploration, and Harvesting the Ocean: San Diego's Commercial Fishing Industry. Public events, such as ""Movies before the Mast'' and family sleepovers aboard the Star of India, also help fulfill the museum's mission.The museum arranges daily voyages on San Diego Bay and weekend adventure sails to Catalina. These outings take place aboard the museum's own schooner, ""Californian,'' which is a replica of a mid-19th century revenue cutter. Additionally, the museum's ships host more than 200 private events each year, from weddings and private parties to meetings, seminars, corporate events and charters.A variety of dockside and at-sea educational programs are conducted, too. Located on the premises, the MacMullen Library & Research Archive serves museum members, educators, maritime scholars, and researchers from around the world. The museum also publishes a peer-reviewed quarterly, ""Mains'l Haul: A Journal of Pacific Maritime History,'' to enhance and encourage the study of maritime events.The museum's hours of operation are 9am to 8pm daily, every day of the year.

Phoenix,"Castles N' Coasters - Phoenix, Arizona - family amusement park","Castles and Coasters is a small family fun park located in Phoenix, Arizona. While the park is open year round, hours of operation may vary because of events, weather, and other factors.Castles n' Coasters features not one, but two of the best roller coasters in Arizona, according to critics. For coaster enthusiasts, nothing compares to Desert Storm, a wild coaster ride with unexpected vertical drops and hairpin turns taken at fast speeds. Guests can also enjoy riding the Patriot, which is milder and appropriate for the more timid roller coaster riders who are just getting their feet wet, so to speak. The park's coasters are the main attraction, but there are other rides for the whole family as well.One of the most popular non-coaster rides is the new Sky Diver. With this ride, guests climb into the car and feel the seat being lifted high above the park, only to suddenly plummet back down to the ground and stomach-dropping speeds. This ride is not for people with certain medical conditions, and guest should watch it in operation before boarding it so they know what to expect.For younger guests and those looking for fun rides that are a but tamer than the park's Sky Dive, Viking Sea Dragon is a good choice. This ride dips and rocks to simulate a boat at sea in a major storm. Guests can also go for a spin on the Magic Carpet ride, and if those are not tame enough, there's also a large Carousel, a beautiful ride featuring 60 hand-crafted horses and circus animals.The park also features a number of water rides, which guests can enjoy on hot days. Visitors can combine some cooling off with a bit of rivalry on the Bumper Boats, where riders can go out of your way to ram and slam other riders buddies into a wall while trying to avoid bumps from other riders. Visitors can also get out aggressions on the Bumper Cars or the Ram Rods, without the cooling effect of the water.The most popular water ride at Castles `n' Coasters, though, is the Splashdown, a log flume ride that takes riders through a logging town and zips through a waterfall and into a pool. There are lockets available at the facility for guests who don't want to spend all day in wet clothes, since many of these rides will end with the riders completely drenched.In addition to the thrill rides, the whole family can enjoy a round or two of miniature golf, time playing games in the arcade, or stroll through the Lil Kids area, where kids can enjoy some carnival rides designed especially for that age group. In addition, Castles `n' Coasters is available for private events and parties, as well as for corporate outings and other events.Hours of operation vary and may change without notice, so the park suggests that guests call before your visit to be certain that the attractions you want to visit are open. Contact the park for information about admission prices and hours of operation at 602-997-7575."

The Hohokam Pima Village is composed of adobe structures and various artifacts that were created by a highly-skilled and brilliant group of ancient peoples. The monument is located on an Native American Reservation called the Gila River which is under tribal ownership. Unfortunately, the ancient village and priceless artifacts are not open to the general public and is an extremely sensitive area filled with history. Prior to the public closing of the village, excavations of the monument area were conducted in the 1930's and then again in the 1960's. The site was inhabited from 300 BC to 1200 AD and is believed to have been home to more than 2,000 people. Excavations of the Hohokam Pima National Monument are no longer allowed, they are restricted by tribal and government law.Archeologists have revealed that the Hohokam Pima people were a farming culture that lasted several centuries in the mesquite-studded desert lands. The culture was advanced and had one of the first irrigation systems in the United States. At the site of the villages, archeologists were able to discover canals that had been hand-dug and extended for miles through the Salt River and Gila River valleys. A large crop of corn, cotton, squash and other vegetation were said to have been watered by the complex irrigation systems. The Pima people were also expert weavers, sculptures, and builders.  The Hohokam were named after a Native American word which means ""that which has vanished"". The former village of the Pima people was named after the Native American world skoaquik, which means ""place of the snakes."" In 1972, the government authorized the village as Hohokam Pima National Monument to protect what is now commonly refereed to as Snaketown.Hohokam Pima National Monument is located on over 2500 acres of land and near a city called Sacaton in southern Arizona. The exact location of the monument is not revealed to the public in order to protect the wishes of the tribe and keep the sensitive area from being disturbed by possible explorers.

Phoenix,Montezuma Castle National Monument Arizona,"The Montezuma Castle has a myriad of ancient dwellings that have excited tourists and explorers since it was first discovered. The ancient houses are located in the north portion of Arizona and is considered one of the state's best national monuments. The antique dwellings are built into the recesses of a limestone cliff that is situated seventy feet above ground. The ruins were named after the Aztecs that archeologists and anthropologists assumed lived in the ruins. Montezuma Castle was declared by President Theodore Roosevelt as being a place of great historic and cultural significance and he established the area as one of the nation's first monuments.Although archeologists initially thought the Aztecs had made the Montezuma Castle their home, it was later discovered that the Sinagua Indian people had actually used the land to meet both their housing and agricultural needs. One of the most interesting aspects of the Montezuma Castle National Monument is the Montezuma Well. There is no admission fee to see the well, and it is well maintained by underground springs. The well is a worthy stop that passes a picnic area and some of the ruins of a hohokam pit house. The well is located about eleven miles from the Montezuma Castle and does not take long to explore. The ancient peoples that once lived in the monument used the well and river access for fresh drinking water and the ability to water their crops. A thousand year old ditch for irrigation is located near the well and is still being used even today. The Montezuma Well provides a constant supply of warm, fresh water and is one of the last pieces of pure water that can be found in the nation.At one point, the National Park Service close the Montezuma Castle because the public was damaging the structure. In order to preserve the integrity of the structure the monument was shut down. Today, visitors are allowed to go into the monument but are not allowed to enter the ruin. Only park personnel are allowed to enter the Montezuma Castle but a virtual tour is available for visitors who want a clear look inside one of the most famous monuments in the United States. The National Park Service allowed the last tourists to journey through the Montezuma Castle more than fifty years ago. The earliest visitors to access the old castle did so by climbing up one of numerous ladders that were propped against the cliff dwellings.Visitors are charged a small fee of $5 per adult in order to enter the main site. Upon arrival to the site, visitors are encouraged to take precautionary measures that includes wearing appropriate shoes, clothing, and bringing water to accommodate the desert conditions. The climate at the monument gets less than 12 inches of rain per year and is extremely arid.

The actual monument is located high on a plateau called Shonto which overlooks a canyon system. The name of the dwellings are called Keet Seel and Betatakin. The name Keet Seel is a Navajo word for ""broken pottery.''  Archeologists believe that at one time 150 people occupied the dwelling. Many of the rooms in the Keet Seel dwelling were actually used for food storage, indicating that the ancient people were expert farmers and successful hunters who were able to thrive in the desert environment. The ancient peoples who lived in the dwellings are believed to have produced crops of beans, corn, and hunted indigenous wild game. The Betatakin dwelling is also Navajo and means ""ledge house."" The dwelling has a cluster of 135 distinct rooms. In order to explore the Betatakin dwelling a strenuous five mile hike is required.

When the Village first opened its doors to the public in 1931, it was a cluster of booths and games with a large Ferris wheel being the focal point. Contestants at the games could win a grand prize of a pony. Highland Park Village followed that tradition and raffled a pony off for many years.The masterminds of Highland Park are Hugh Prather and Edgar Fillpen who eventually hired Wilbur David Cook to help plan the community. The area of Highland Park was designed by the Beverly Hill's architect, Wilbur David Cook. The noted architect took Highland Park and created an area that rivaled Beverly Hills in its beauty. It is still considered by many as one of the most beautiful communities in the United States.The two creators of Highland Park (Hugh Prather and Edgar Fillipen) wanted to create a a shopping center that would double as a town square. The architecture of Highland Park was inspired by Barcelona and Seville, Spain. Elements of Spanish and California culture and architecture went into the construction of Highland Park Village. The park has mediterranean flair that includes arched windows and doors, red tile roofs, brick walkways and beautiful landscaping.Highland Park Village sits on approximately 9.9 acres and has retail square footage measuring 200,000 square feet.

The West End Historic District definitely has some great points, but it isn't all fun and glory. There are flaws to the district, but nothing that cannot be rectified with effective planning. For example, parking in the district is tight because of the growing popularity of the area.

The bike trail is 9.3 miles long and makes a perfect loop around the lake. The park offers information for those who want to rent a bike from a rental place in close proximity to the park. White Rock Lake Park is used by the public for a variety of activities. Bicycling, fishing, boating, picnics, sporting games, and even weddings are all part of the activity that takes place there.One of the most interesting and ecologically friendly programs that was instituted by the For the Love of the Lake Organization is the Adopt-A-Shoreline Program. The program has run for twelve years and enables groups to adopt a small portion of the lake's shoreline with the promise that they will keep the area litter-free. Each month members who have adopted the shoreline show up at the park and clean their adopted area. Currently, over forty organizations actively participate in the Adopt-A-Shoreline program. Participants who come to clean the shoreline monthly are rewarded with a continental breakfast and bottled water before the spruce up begins.White Rock Lake Park in Dallas is also committed to reforestation and maintaining the natural beauty of the city of Dallas. In April of 2006, the park established The Celebration Tree Grove where people can honor and remember loved ones by donating to reforestation efforts heralded by the park. The grove is located in the northeast area of the park and new trees are placed there to surround the pathways. Donations of $1,000 or more are celebrated with a bronze plaque that is placed among the tree groves. The Celebration Tree Grove consists of an array of cypress, oak, elm, cherry, buckthorn, holly, and many other tree varieties.Volunteers who want to give back to White Rock Lake Park are always welcome to participate in the on going restoration, recycling, cleaning, and adoption efforts that are consistently taking place."

Dallas,Zero Gravity Thrill Amusement Park,"The Zero Gravity Thrill Amusement Park is full of adventuresome activities for individuals who are not faint of heart. The park is located ten minutes north of downtown Dallas.  Activities like bungee jumping, free-falling, and hand gliding are possible options of those who visit the amusement park. Zero Gravity Thrill Amusement Park was established in 1992 and has continued to garner a steady stream of visitors since its doors first opened. Visitors to the amusement park want to experience an adrenaline rush and Zero Gravity provides a safe environment to do so. The park has earned the reputation as being the best place to go bungee jumping in Dallas.There are five main attractions at Zero Gravity Thrill Amusement Park. The five attractions are Bungee Jumping, Skycoaster, Texas Blastoff, Nothing but Net and the Skyscraper. Bungee jumping is the most popular attraction at the park. Visitors begin their bungee jumping experience at the Air Boingo Tower. The Air Boingo Tower is a seven story permanent platform. A second attraction at the amusement park is called the Skycoaster. The Skycoaster is a hand-gliding simulator that sits over a hundred feet in the air. The glider reaches speeds of sixty miles per hour and is suitable for up to three persons to fly together. The Texas Blastoff was created for two people. The ride races up into the air at seventy miles per hour and twist, flips, and turns. Those who experience the ride are strapped down into racing seats that are affixed to a steel ring. The Skyscraper which is the park's latest installment is similar to the Skycoaster. The Skyscraper is meant to accommodate four people and is an enormous propeller that whips through the air, spinning like a windmill at sixty miles per hour. When the Skyscraper finally comes to a stop, riders can see a bird-eye view of downtown Dallas.The final main attraction at the park is called Nothin but Net. Nothin but Net is exactly what it sounds like. For the experience, an individual is taken 16 stories into the air and then released without a parachute or bungee chord. Two nets are placed under the individual to safely break the fall.Many customers have concerns about the safety issues of experiencing some of the adventures that Zero Gravity Thrill Amusement Park provide.

San Jose,"Alum Rock Park - San Jose, California - Among California's Oldest Municipal Parks","Set within the foothills of the Diablo Range northeast of San Josy, Alum Rock Park occupies a portion of Alum Rock Canyon, where acres of rugged terrain provide opportunities to enjoy nature. ""Alum'' refers to deposits of aluminum sulfate concentrated in the area.Although Alum Rock Park was not formally named until the 20th century, its acreage was set aside as a ""reservation'' in 1872. Between 1870 and 1932, many visitors came here to bathe in the waters of 27 mineral springs, giving the park a reputation as a health spa. Crowds of nature lovers from the Santa Clara Valley threatened to harm the natural environs in the 1950s and 60s.To protect the local ecology, Alum Rock Park was converted from a multi-use facility to emphasis on the family outdoor activities that can be enjoyed here today. The park supports hiking, biking and horseback riding, picnicking and barbecuing. There is also a playground area for children in the mid-canyon area.The park's Visitor Center/Ranger Office is at the center of everything, located mid-canyon.

It also passes by an old electric railway bed. A shorter hike is the mile-long Woodland Trail to Eagle Rock on the canyon's north slope. And two other recommended hikes are the North Rim Trail and Todd Quick Trail, both of which are to the north of the Visitor Center.Alum Rock Park has numerous picnic areas available with tables and barbecue stoves, some of which are accessible by car and others only on foot. They can be reserved for groups of up to 300 persons. One picnic area, The Ramada, includes a covered shelter.

Austin,"Barton Creek Resort & Spa, Fazio Canyons Course, Austin, Texas - A Tom Fazio Signature Golf Course in the Hill Country Outside Austin","Barton Creek Resort & Spa can boast four championship golf courses designed by some of the best-known and most respected names in golf: Crenshaw, Palmer and Fazio. The first course to open at the resort was the Fazio Foothills, and he followed that up in 1999 with the Fazio Canyons layout.The Fazio Canyons course is located two miles from the resport proper in the Hill Country around Short Springs Branch, the creek with a limestone bed that wanders through the layout. The course is also lined with stately Sycamore and Red Oak trees and is said to be one of the lushest courses and best-maintained in the state.The underlying rugged terrain gives the course a good deal of character, as it winds through the canyon and up and down hills. There are both elevated tee boxes and greens, as well as numerous natural hazards, such as prickly-pear cacti and a variety of trees. The greens are also tricky. Though very large, they are said to be fast, undulating and difficult to read at times.The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,153 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.1 and a slope rating of 141. While the locals have been known to say that the first Fazio course, Foothills, has more dramatic holes, they agree that the newer Canyons course is the overall better layout.It also has some noteworthy holes, including No. 9. This par-4 plays to 457 yards from the tips, which contributes to its ranking as one of the toughest holes on the course. The tee shot plays uphill, while a creek cascades down the hill from green to tee along the right side of the hole.No. 10 sets the tone for the back nine and is one of the signature holes at Barton Creek. Another long par-4 at 442 yards from the tips, this hole features a severe dogleg right that requires a tee shot to the left side of the fairway. From there, players must take aim at a very small green that appears to be sliding into a rushing creek that guards the putting surface.The finishing hole on Fazio Canyons is a par-5 that plays to 561 yards from the longest tees. This hole is said to rival the finishing hole on the Foothills course, and calls for a good deal of strategy. Water crosses the fairway twice and the hole plays downhill from the tee, giving players a number of decisions along the way. The second stream cuts right in front of a narrow green, and there's also a live oak just short of the putting surface that must be carried to get home safely.Since its opening, Fazio Canyons has garnered a number of awards. GOLF Magazine listed it among the Top 100 Golf Coures You Can Play in 2006, while Golf Digest ranked it #83 on its list of America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses in 2007-2008.Fazio Canyons is also home to the highly acclaimed Chuck Cook Golf Academy, which is ranked as one of the best golf schools in the country.

The first course to open at the resort was the Fazio Foothills in 1986.The Fazio Foothills course features some dramatic fairways lined by cliffs and natural limestone caves, as well as waterfalls, and provides plenty of visual impact as well as elevation change. Fazio placed a premium in this design on long, accurate drives and, when combined with small greens with undulating aprons and grass bunkers, shot-making is the order of the day on the Foothills course.The course got an update in 2004, with Fazio representatives consulted on where to add yardage and tees to improve the layout and the challenge. The course also received new grass on the fairways and greens, while gaining nearly 200 extra yards. The 18-hole, par-72 course now plays to 7,125 yards from the longest tees.Most courses have a signature hole or two, but it's been said that the Foothills course makes it difficult to choose. Hole No. 9 is a dramatic par-3 that always gets some votes. This hole plays to 178 yards from the tips, making it a relatively short hole that also plays downhill. From the tee, players take aim at a split level green which is one of the largest on the course, but slopes severely from top to bottom. Tee shots must carry a casade of creeks and waterfalls to safely reach this putting surface.Hole No. 10 is a par-4 that also gets some votes. From the tee to the fairway there's a drop-off of nearly 100 feet and finding the fairway can appear daunting from the tee box. If players can avoid the water and sand on the left and a tree on the right, they have a chance of reaching a fairly small green and making a good score.Hole No. 16 also gets some votes. This is a dangerous par-4 that plays to 422 yards and is annually ranked as one of the pretiest and most difficult in the state. From the tee, there's a tunnel-like driving area that leads to a much more expansive landing area. For players who get a good look at the green on their second shot, they'll find the putting surface guarded in the front by a large, watery drop-off and a thunderous waterfall that can be a bit distracting when putting.The finishing hole at Fazio Foothills is a par-5 that plays to 560 yards from the tips, and always gets some notoriety as one of the best finishing holes to be found. Along the way, golfers will encounter an abandoned bat cave and an elevated green that's fronted by a canyon.Since its opening, Fazio Foothills has set the standard for golf at the Barton Creek Resort, and garnered a number of awards. The Foothills Course has been rated the #1 Resort Course in Texas for many years, and has been ranked as high as #4 in the country. It has also been host to the Champions Tour Legends of Golf tournament."

San Francisco,"Alcatraz Island In San Francisco, California","Prison buildings on Alcatraz Island, San FranciscoFew places conjure up as many negative and frightening thoughts as Alcatraz Island, yet every year, millions of tourists make the trek to visit what was once one of Americas toughest federal prisons. Alcatraz is one of the most popular tourist attractions in San Francisco, and finds its air of mystery created from books and movies. People from all over the world find themselves drawn to the island, to view firsthand the site where America housed some of its most famous criminals. You can ride the Alcatraz ferry across San Francisco Bay, finding thousands of visitors wandering the grounds in complete fascination.In 1775, the Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala charted the area known as the San Francisco Bay, naming it La Isla de los Alcatraes, which in translation means, ""Island of the Pelicans'', henceforth it became known by the American name, Alcatraz. By 1847, the US Army took notice of the tiny island and what it could provide in terms of military fortification. In 1853, the Army Corps of Engineers began constructing a military fort and introduced along with it, the first operational lighthouse on the Pacific Coast.Gold was discovered along the California coastline in 1848, with it came boatloads of miners from all corners of the globe. The US Government, increased security measures, in order to protect its gold and resources, thus Alcatraz was born. It stood as a testament to American military strength. Alcatraz featured long range cannons, four 36,000 pound Rodman guns, which could sink massive ships up to three miles away. However, as the times progressed the use of Alcatraz as a military fortress began to wane.By 1861, Alcatraz had become a military prison, housing prisoners of the Civil War. In 1889, during the Spanish-American war, the inmate population expanded exponentially from 26 prisoners, to over 450. The San Francisco earthquake in 1906, brought about the need to transfer the civilian prisoners to the island for confinement. In 1912, there was an additional large housing unit constructed and by the late 1920's, a three story facility was added.Due to high operational costs, the military decided to close the prison in 1934, and ownership went to the US Department Of Justice. During the late 20's and 30's, America experience a surge in the crime rates as the Great Depression ensued. Alcatraz was viewed as a viable solution to this ever-growing problem. In April of 1934, the face of Alcatraz changed as updates and additional security measures were enacted, such as the Special Gun Galleries.Alcatraz as a prison, was home to some of the most infamous criminals in American history. During its heyday some of its inmates were Al Capone, George ""Machine Gun'' Kelley, Henry Young, and perhaps the most well known, Robert Stroud, known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz''. There were 14 total escape attempts recorded in Alcatraz history, most inmates were either caught, died from injuries or were missing and presumed dead. In October 1973, Alcatraz was officially opened to the public and drew more than 50,000 visitors. In addition to serving as a popular tourist attraction, American Indians return every year in November to commemorate their 1969 occupation on the island, it is home to the Alcatraz lighthouse which is the oldest lighthouse in the west, and the islands two foghorns still ring throughout the Golden Gate area, which continues to add an air of mystique to the island."

San Francisco,"Cable Cars, a San Francisco Tradition","San Francisco streetcarOn September 1, 1873 the very first San Francisco cable car was placed into operation. Cable cars, which continue to run in San Francisco to this day, were the invention of Andrew Hallidie, a native of England.As he was out and about in San Francisco one rainy afternoon, he witnessed five horses die as they tried to pull a street car up a hill. A combination of the wet cobblestones and the weight of the car made the task too much for the animals. Hallidie knew there had to be a way to prevent such a tragedy from happening again .As it happened, Hallidie's father held the patent in Great Britain for wire rope. Over the years, Hallidie had found many uses for the rope. One was pulling heavy cars out of mines. He knew that the rope would be the perfect alternative to animal power for use in San Francisco's street cars .Opening the first cable operated car on Clay Street came at a cost of close to $86,000. Since that fall day in 1873, cable cars have been a recognizable feature of the San Francisco landscape. So famous are the cars that in 1964 they were recognized as a moving historical landmark .While the strength of animals would no longer be required to pull San Francisco street cars, there is still a need for some muscle. As the cars are pulled along by an underground cable, the cable must be ""gripped'' by a device that is much like a vice. It requires a good amount of upper body strength to be a grip operator on a cable car. It wasn't until 1998 that San Francisco welcomed its first female grip operator.There is also a museum dedicated to the cable cars. The Cable Car Barn and Powerhouse is home to a variety of antique cables cars, including the very first one that took the run in September of 1873. Visitors to the museum can also get a close up look at some of the mechanisms that are needed to run a cable car including grips and breaks among others .In April of 1906, a powerful earthquake damaged the cable car system. After that, most of the city's public transportation was changed to streetcars. But there are still three routes in San Francisco that are serviced by cable cars, and visitors and residents alike enjoy riding on these small pieces of history."
San Francisco,"Candlestick Park - San Francisco, California - Home field for the San Francisco 49ers NFL football team","Once the home field of the San Francisco Giants, a professional baseball team, Candlestick Park is now the stadium of the San Francisco 49ers, the city's NFL team. This park has been the home of the 49ers since 1971, but that may change soon, as a new stadium is currently being planned. Candlestick Park, known to fans as ""The Stick'' is located at Candlestick Point, which is directly on the bay. Because of this location, Candlestick Park is considered one of the most difficult places to play, as bay winds affect how the ball travels while being thrown and kicked.Candlestick Park was officially opened in 1960, and the name comes from a contest the city ran for fans. Along with being the home of the Giants, this was also the site of the 1961 Oakland Raiders season and the last live concert the Beatles ever played commercially.As of today, Candlestick Park is the only NFL stadium to have its beginnings as a baseball facility. Because of this, there are some seating problems for fans. For example, the upper deck somewhat obstructs part of the view for the seats below. A 1970s design renovation that was meant to add more upper-level seating also destroyed the view of the Bay and, although it reduced wind speeds, the wind now swirls and is more unpredictable. Baseball fans frequently criticized the park as much as NFL fans, due to the fact that the seats were far from the field and the foul territory was bigger than normal. The Giants still played at this stadium until 2000, when they moved to South Beach's AT&T Park.The stadium currently seats over 70,000 fans and originally cost $24.6 million to build. The stadium sits on an 82-acre site and employs over 1500 people on game days. The field was artificial from 1972 to 1979, but at that point, it was returned to its natural state. The sod is replaced every year, and it is sometimes also replaced mid-season, depending on the weather. It is a common misconception that the field is below sea level, but in actuality, it is almost 14 feet above sea level.Along with regular seats, there are a number of luxury suites available for fans who want to watch the game from a more comfortable location. Each suite has glass windows that can be opened or closed according to the viewers' preferences. They also have televisions that show all of the other games happening at that time, and season suite tickets come with a number of benefits, including a 15% discount on merchandise, VIP parking, the option to purchase tickets to post-season games, complimentary programs and roster cards, giveaways, and 49ers alumni and cheerleaders visits. Suites fit eight to twenty-seven fans.There are a limited number of games remaining at Candlestick Park, since the 49ers will be moving to a new stadium sometime after 2011. Fans interested in tickets to a game or other events can call 415-656-4900 or 408-562-4949. They can also give fans more information about setting up a tour of the facility."
San Francisco,"Fisherman's Wharf On Monterey Harbor In San Fransisco, California","Monterey Jetty in CaliforniaIn 1602, explorer Sebastian Viscaino was sent by the Viceroy of New Spain to explore California and its western coast. Viscaino was to map his findings and locate a port for Manila galleons to use for transporting goods from the Philippines to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. He landed in Monterey and christened the harbor after the Count of Monterey. The City of Monterey was founded in 1770, by the Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola. When the Spanish-Mexican war broke out in 1822, California was seized and added to the Mexican Empire. In 1846, the Mexican-American War broke out and Commodore Sloat, landed in Monterey and declared California for the Union.The Pacific Coast Steamship Company, built a wharf for regular passengers and freight purposes in 1870. In 1913, ownership of the wharf was assumed by the City Council, to provide maintenance for the wharf and oversee the thriving sardine industry. It was at some point during this time period that it became known as ""Fisherman's Wharf'', by which it is still known today.In 1916, the City bought the wharf and began an expansion project, which provided more services for fishing and fleet businesses. By the 1920's, the wharf was home to over 20 warehouses, retail fishing outlets, restaurants, marine service station and an abalone shell grinding company. In March 1923, a large load of sardines was waiting to be loaded onto the S.S. San Antonio for transport. Treacherous weather conditions caused 123 feet of pier to collapse and the entire sardine shipment sank into the harbor. When it came time to rebuild the wharf, an additional 750 feet was added and a finger pier was built eastward.City Officials began to rally for more construction on the wharf to provide relief of congestion, due to commercial fishing demands. Bonds were voted in and the wharf was expanded and Municipal Wharf II was created in 1925. It was during the time of World War II, when sardines began to diminish that the wharf became a tourist attraction. By the time 1956 rolled around, there were candy stores, restaurants, a theater, aquarium, snack bars, boat rentals, and many other attractions.In 1969, the state appropriated $325,000.00 in funding to build an additional bulkhead wall, more parking spaces and a promenade were added as well. Fisherman's Wharf has continued to grow and thrive even now, with thousands of travelers enjoying the various businesses located throughout the wharf. There are also whale watching and harbor cruises offered throughout the year. The City Of Monterey continues to make improvements to the wharf on a consistent basis, thus enhancing the area for both tourists and the general public."
San Francisco,"Golden Gate Bridge - San Francisco, California - Enduring Symbol of San Francisco","Widely acclaimed as one of the world's most beautiful spans, San Francisco's famous Golden Gate Bridge has been a symbol of the city on the bay since 1937. It was constructed over a period of four years at a cost of more than $35 million, with tall towers, sweeping main cables, and its distinctive orange vermilion color.The bridge's name does not, however, come from its coloring but from the Golden Gate Strait which it passes over. The three-mile long and one-mile wide body of water serves as the entrance to San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. When it was first seen by Army Captain John C. Fremont around 1846, he named the strait ""Chrysopylae'' or ""Golden Gate'' after a harbor of which it reminded him - Istanbul's ""Golden Horn.''The bridge has nonetheless always been painted ""international orange.'' The color was selected by Architect Irving Morrow to blend well with the warm colors of the nearby land masses, while providing enhanced visibility for passing ships.Upon its opening, the 4,200-foot-long suspension span of the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest in the world. It remained so until New York City's Verrazano Narrows Bridge was completed in 1964. At mid-span, the Golden Gate's roadway reaches a height of 270 feet above the water's surface, rising gradually from the south abutment at a height of 186 feet, allowing for even the tallest ships to pass beneath.In 1968, the Golden Gate Bridge became the world's first major bridge to institute one-way toll collection. This system was so successful, it was subsequently implement on many other bridges around the globe. Today, tolls are collected in the southbound direction only, going into San Francisco. The rate for two-axle vehicles and motorcycles is $6 if paid in cash and $5 using FasTrak, an electronic toll system operated by Caltrans. Larger vehicles pay $3 cash per axle or $2.50 with FasTrak.By the close of 2009, more than 1,874,100,000 vehicles had crossed the Golden Gate Bridge. Estimates have put the number of annual visitors to the structure at about nine million people from all around the world. It can be particularly busy in summer.The bridge is open to pedestrian traffic, wheelchair users, and bicyclists via the sidewalks during daylight hours. Those on foot must share the east 1.7-mile-long sidewalk with cyclists on weekdays. Please note, however, that roller blades, skateboards and roller skates are not allowed, and dogs are permitted only if under control on a leash at all times.Excellent vantage points for viewing the bridge can be found the Fort Point overlook near the southeast parking lot as well as the renovated garden area nearby. Map of walking, biking and hiking trails located on the south side of the Golden Gate Bridge can be obtained in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and at The PresidioThe Golden Gate Bridge also has a Gift Center, which is located in the historic ""Roundhouse'' on the southeast side behind the Strauss Statue. The building was designed in 1938 as a restaurant for motorists. Now, it is open from 8:30am each day, offering historical information, photos, books, posters, videos, and various souvenirs. It closes at 7:30pm during the summer and 6:30pm in winter. Food is available at the Bridge Cafy nearby. Open daily from 9:30am to 5pm, it serves muffins, sandwiches, salads, desserts, sodas, water and Starbuck's coffee.Although it does not have a physical address, the Golden Gate Bridge is easy to find by following Highway 101 to where it spans the strait between San Francisco and Sausalito. There are parking areas and restrooms on both the northeast and southeast sides, and spaces for persons with disabilities are provided."
San Francisco,Golden Gate National Recreation Area an Urban Oasis,"More than twice the size of the city of San Francisco, Golden Gate National Recreation Area covers 75,398 acres of land and water in the greater San Francisco area. One of the largest urban parks in the world, this recreation area includes five national historic landmarks, 12 properties on the National Register of Historic Places, 739 historic structures, 61 recorded archaeological sites, and nine documented cultural landscapes.Like many urban parks, Golden Gate is not made up of one continuous stretch of land but instead consists of several different locales within an area that stretches from northern San Mateo County to south Marin County. Some parts of the Golden Gate Recreation Area include well-known tourist attractions - like Alcatraz and Muir Woods - while others are less familiar to most visitors. Nonetheless, it's a fascinating place to explore, both inside and outside the City by the Bay, including miles of picturesque Pacific Ocean shoreline, lots of military installations, and a variety of flora and fauna typical of the area.An act to establish the Golden Gate Recreation Area was signed in 1972. Money allocated for the development of the park allowed for the purchase by the National Park Service of many historic sites and natural areas.It takes days to see everything that is included as part of this large urban expanse. In the city and county of San Francisco, sites and landmarks of interest include famous Alcatraz Island; Forts Mason and Funston; Lands End natural preserve and historic Mile Rock Lighthouse; the Presidio, a former military installation that includes Baker Beach, Crissy Airfield, and the San Francisco National Cemetery; Ocean Beach, a mecca for surfers; and the Sutro Heights area, which includes the historic Sutro Baths and the Cliff House Restaurant.In San Mateo County, the recreation area includes 240-acre Milagra Ridge, a former Nike missile site and home to many endangered species of animals; Sweeney Ridge, home to World War II lookout nests; Mori Point, a recently acquired undeveloped parcel of land; and the Phleger Estate, featuring beautiful Coastal Redwoods and a portion of the Bay Area Ridge Trail.Portions of the park are also located in Marin County, including historic Fort Baker; Muir Woods National Monument; Marin Headlands, which includes several beaches, forts, and the Marine Mammal Center; the Point Bonita Lighthouse; shark-infested Stinson Beach; and the Muir Beach Overlook, a former naval base that provides amazing views of the surrounding area.Because of the diversity of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, activities are many, including sightseeing, swimming, surfing, bike riding, hiking, boating, and more. Camping is available at four campgrounds within the Marin Headlands, though all four are rather small and fairly remote. Prior reservations are suggested at these year-round campsites."
San Francisco,"International Children's Art Museum World Trade Center - San Francisco, California - Youthful Art Showcased in an Historic Building","Located within the World Trade Center section of San Francisco's landmark Ferry Building, the International Children's Art Museum features art from children around the world. Its purpose is to help viewers broaden their perspective of art and cultures by displaying, comparing, and contrasting the many ways in which youth the world over interpret life.Given its own international heritage, the nearly 240,000-square-foot Ferry Building is in many ways the perfect venue for this museum. Originally built between 1896 and 1903 as a central ferry port, the structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its neo-Romanesque fazade and 240-foot-high clock tower were modeled after the campanile of Seville Cathedral known as the Giralda. The building and its tower survived the devastating earthquake of 1906 intact to become the symbol of San Francisco for decades.In 1956, the World Trade Center took up residence in the Ferry Building's north wing, providing an exhibition space for products from all parts of the globe. This is where the International Children's Art Museum chose to locate, developing its own exhibitions, educational activities, and publications aimed at greater appreciation of the creativity, talents, and diversity of youthful artists from all over the world.In total, five programs have been developed to help the International Children's Art Museum achieve its mission. The most obvious and prominent one is the ""Museum Exhibition Galleries,'' where children's art is recognized and displayed. A second is the ""Travelling Exhibition Program,'' which takes the museum's collected works out to other communities.Two other focuses are the ""Product Development Program'' and the ""Art Workshop Program,'' which encourage hands-on creativity among youth. In fact, one much-appreciated aspect of the International Children's Art Museum is its ""drop-in art workshops'' for kids held on Saturdays. And the ""International School Art & Writing Exchange Program'' brings students of the world together through communication in words as well as pictures.A theme that runs through all of the museum's work is something called ""Paintbrush Diplomacy.'' It is the idea that art can bridge differences in language and culture. In this sense, the museum is meant for adults as well as children.The operating hours of the International Children's Art Museum are from 11am to 5pm on Monday through Friday and 10am to 4pm on Saturdays. The admission fee is one dollar for adults and fifty cents for children. Food and drink are not allowed in the museum, but there several restaurants and cafys located within the Ferry Building Marketplace on the first floor of the south wing.The International Children's Art Museum is located at the intersection of Embarcadero and Market Street. The address is Suite 103, World Trade Center, Ferry Building, San Francisco, California, 94111. It is easily reached via public transportation, served by the MUNI, Golden Gate Transit, BART and F Train. Access by water is also available with the Golden Gate Ferry, Blue and Gold Fleet, and Bay Link Ferries.For those who come by car, valet parking is provided in front of the Ferry Building from 9:30am to 10pm on Monday through Friday. Convenient parking is also offered at the adjacent Pier 1/2 Lot, which will accept validations from San Francisco Ferry Building merchants. Metered parking can be found on the area's surface streets, too."
San Francisco,Muir Woods National Monument California,"Muir Woods National Monument covers five hundred acres of land and is located only twelve miles north of San Francisco, California. The monument was designated to protect and preserve redwood forests of trees that have been a part of the coastal landscape for centuries. Redwood trees are a natural occurrence along the western coast of the United States and centuries ago millions of acres of forests that were rich in redwoods grew undisturbed. It wasn't until the 20th century that deforestation started and the redwoods begin to get cutdown. The reason the Muir Woods was left undisturbed was due to their relative inaccessibility. The forest was saved by a congressman, William Kent, who purchased the monument site and then donated the area to the federal government in a last ditch effort to save and protect the ancient trees.The forest is shrouded in coastal fogs on a regular basis because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. The thick fog that invades the forest keeps the humidity high at the monument site, providing moisture and encouraging thick growths of vegetation. The forest grounds are coated with lush patches of flora and other exotic plant species can be found among the trees. The redwoods themselves draw moisture from the environment in order to sustain them throughout the dryer months. Redwoods can grow up to 380 feet tall, and the tallest measured tree in the Muir Woods National Monument is at a height of 258 feet. The average temperature at Muir Woods National Monument ranges between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.Muir Woods National Monument is operated by the National Park Service as well as the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The monument holds events throughout the year to draw more tourists to the area. An annual footrace is one such event that passes through Muir Woods.Each year almost a million visitors attend Muir Woods National Monument. It is a major tourist destination in the San Francisco Bay area. Every year, attendance increases as more of the public is made aware of the undisturbed, natural beauty that composes the monument. The trees range in age and are an average of 650 years old. One of the oldest trees in the Muir Woods is at least 1,200 years old.Some of the other trees at Muir Woods National Monument that attracts crowds are the Tanoak, Bigleaf Maple, and California Bay Laurel tree. There is a complex ecosystem in the forests that allows each tree to thrive naturally. Animals are plentiful in the area as well. The forest is home to deers, bears, bats, and over fifty different species of birds. Paved and unpaved hiking trails are available to visitors who are interested in seeing the trees up close, bird watching, or simply exploring the forest area. Ranger walks are also available. Visitors to Muir Woods National Monument are only allowed to hike - camping and picnicking are not allowed in the area. A Visitors Center is located on the monument grounds and contains exhibits and a gift shop. An entrance fee of $5 is required to enter the park - children are admitted into the monument for free."

New York,African Burial Ground National Monument is in the Heart of New York City,"Located at the corner of Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan, New York, the African Burial Ground National Monument is a tribute to the more than fifteen thousand 17th- and 18th-century free and enslaved Africans that were buried in a 6.6-acre site that sits at this spot, which was once part of the outskirts of New Amsterdam (later New York City).The idea for the monument arose in 1991 after the first body was discovered during excavation for a new federal office building that was to be built at the site. Remains of more than 400 of those individuals were eventually discovered at this location. The previously undiscovered cemetery had been covered with development and landfill since the time of the burials and the discovery of the initial body prompted an outcry by the local African community to build a monument that would honor the dead and draw attention to the plight of early Africans in America. Two years after the initial discovery, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark. In 2003, the remains of the hundreds that were discovered were rewarded with a final resting place at the site, where a ceremony was held to mark the re-interment.Ground was broken for the monument, which is maintained and operated by the National Park Service, in September 2005. A contest was held to determine the design, with the winning creation belonging to Haitian-American architect Rodney Leon. His 25-foot granite monument is entitled ""The Door of Return'', which references the infamous Doors of No Return, a name given to slave ports in West Africa. Leon's monument was officially dedicated in October 2007 and is considered a successful collaboration of a number of entities, including not only the National Park Service but also the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Howard University, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and the African American community of New York City.In addition to the monument, the onsite Visitor/Interpretive Center includes displays and exhibits pertaining to African-American history and culture in New York City and also displays commemorative art commissioned specifically for the African Burial Ground National Monument. Guests may explore on their own or take advantage of ranger-led tours of the center. Located inside an adjacent federal office building, the Visitor Center is open during regular business hours. Also offered through the interpretive center is a 90-minute walking tour that explores the African presence in the early days of New York. Reservations are suggested, especially for large groups.Special events, workshops, and programs for all ages are held year round but especially during February, which is designated as Black History Month. Most activities are offered free of charge."
New York,New York City's Metropolitan Opera a Cultural Gem Inside and Out,"The foremost opera house in the United States and one of the most renowned in the world, New York City's Metropolitan Opera has launched the careers of many singers, conductors, and instrumentalists. Often mentioned in the same breath as the great opera houses of Europe, such as Milan's La Scala, the grand performances at the Metropolitan Opera have reached opera lovers the world over via televised performances, radio broadcasts, CDs, and DVDs.The idea for an opera house in New York City was initiated in 1883 and the first one was built shortly thereafter at a location on the corner of 39th Street and Broadway. Founded by a group of wealthy business owners, The Met - as it is usually called - first performed everything in Italian, even non-Italian operas. When Wagner became popular, all operas at The Met were performed in German. Eventually, however, the importance of performing these works in their native language eventually became apparent and The Met has adhered to that policy ever since.Early performers at the Metropolitan Opera included Christine Nilsson, Marcella Sembrich, Lilli Lehmann, Nellie Melba, Emma Earnes, Lillian Nordica, and the great Enrico Caruso, the latter of whom performed more times at The Met than at all the world's opera companies combined, despite his world-wide popularity.In 1931, the Metropolitan Opera first introduced its Saturday afternoon radio performances, with live broadcasts aired each weekend from December through April. The first broadcasts were heard throughout the U.S. and Canada. They continue today, now reaching millions of listeners worldwide.In the 1960s, the Metropolitan Opera - which had already outgrown its facilities - joined several other New York cultural institutions to form the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and the building of a new facility was now deemed a possibility. The new Metropolitan Opera opened as the centerpiece of Lincoln Center in 1966, boasting world-class acoustics and a highly-mechanized stage with multiple elevators. It quickly earned fame as a premiere opera venue.Designed by architect Wallace K. Harrison, the outside of the building is clad in white travertine and features 5 graceful glass arches which allow visitors to take a peek inside at the grand red-carpeted spiral staircases that lead to the 3,800-seat theater, decorated in deep red and gold. The lobby also features ornate Austrian crystal chandeliers, and enormous works of art by modernist Belarusian-French artist Marc Chagall sit on either side of the staircase.In 1995, The Met added yet another technical innovation to its theater with the addition of ""Met Titles'', a simultaneous translation system that allows viewers to read the English translation of foreign operas while watching the production. This is done by means of computerized screens mounted in small railings at the back of each row of seats.Under the direction of James Levine since 1976, today's Metropolitan Opera continues to expand its influence through televised productions and, more recently, ""Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD,'' a series of performances that are shown live in high definition (HD) in movie theaters around the world. The Met also has its own channel on SIRIUS Satellite Radio."
New York,Empire State Building is One of New York's Most Recognizable Landmarks,"New York City skyline at sunset with Empire State BuildingBuilt during the Great Depression and originally designed as a symbol of one particular company's financial power, the Empire State Building has become more a symbol of American strength and fortitude during difficult times, and remains one of Manhattan's most popular tourist attractions, often attracting upwards of 10,000-15,000 visitors or more each day.The Empire State Building was built in 1930 and was immediately recognized as the tallest building in the world. Its construction was ordered by John Jakob Raskob, the founder of General Motors, in response to the building of the Chrysler Building by arch-rival, Walter Chrysler. Raskob wished to erect a structure that would dwarf Chrysler's attractive Art Deco skyscraper, which was completed just 11 months prior to the opening of the Empire State Building.The architect for Raskob's project was William Lamb of the New York architectural firm Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon. It is said that he based his design on the long, clean lines of a pencil. He was also influenced by the designs of Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, who was famous for his art nouveau creations.It took just 18 months to build the 102-story, 1,250-foot-tall skyscraper, and a handful of men were killed in construction-related accidents. Records show that the men built at great speeds, completing approximately 4.5 stories of framework each week at the onset of the project. Many of the workers were European immigrants and others included the famous Mohawk iron workers from the Kahnawake Reservation near Montreal, Quebec.As was typical of designs of the time, this Art Deco creation utilizations several setbacks to offset the visual distortion common with a building of this enormous height. Approximately 200,000 cubic feet of Indiana limestone and granite was used for the facade. The stone was rough cut at the quarry and required no final cutting once it was put in place, saving time and pleasing Raskob, who was in a hurry to complete the skyscraper and beat Chrysler. He also proposed that the posts, beams, windows and window frames be made in factories and put together at the site. Most of the 60,000 tons of steel used for this purpose came from steel mills in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and arrived by train or barge.Once the initial 88 floors were completed, the additional 14 floors of the Empire State Building were constructed of glass, steel, and aluminum, measuring about 200 feet tall with a dome sitting on top. A metal-plated tower was originally designed to moor zeppelins but the winds at that elevation made it nearly impossible to accomplish that task. In 1951, a broadcasting antenna was added and the tower was put to use as storage space for equipment.The Empire State Building remained the tallest building in the world until the completion of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1972, which was - in turn - surpassed by Chicago's Sears Tower in 1973. (After the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, the Empire State Building resumed its status as the tallest structure in NYC.) It was declared a landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1981 and was placed on the State and National Register of Historic Places the following year. In 1986, it became a National Historic Landmark.Today, more than 120 million people have visited the Empire State Building. After admiring the ornate three-story lobby complete with an aluminum relief of the skyscraper and eight illuminated panels proclaiming the structure to be the Eighth Wonder of the World, guests generally head to the observation tower on the 86th floor. It takes just one minute to get there via one of the building's 73 elevators. For an additional fee, visitors may board an elevator to the 102nd floor observation deck, which was closed in 1999 but reopened in 2005. This deck, unlike the other, is completely enclosed.Each evening, New York City visitors can view the powerful colored spotlights that illuminate the tower. While the lights are often red, white, and blue, they do change on occasion in commemoration of particular events or holidays or to honor New York City's sports teams."
New York,"Astroland - New York, New York - historic Coney Island amusement park","Astroland, opened in 1962, was the last remaining amusement part in operation at Coney Island. The historic park closed permanently on September 7, 2008, but one of the rides - The Cyclone - still remains in operation today, keeping the park alive. The original concept of Astroland was the Space Age, and all of the rides were themed to the U.S. space program. It was the site of the most famous roller coaster in the world, the Cyclone, the iconic symbol of Coney Island. Despite the closing of Astroland, the Cyclone continues operation thanks to its status as a National Historic Landmark and the continued oversight of the former owners of Astroland, the Albert family.The park opened in 1962 under the ownership and management of Dewey Albert. The original rides were commissioned and built on the theme of ""Journey to the 21st Century''. The rides included the Cape Canaveral Satellite Jet, which simulated liftoff and a trip to the moon. The Rocket became another iconic symbol of Astroland and Coney Island. After the park closed in 2008 and the rocket was dismantled, a committee of citizens petitioned the city and succeeded in saving the rocket. The Astroland rocket is slated to become a centerpiece of the Coney Island redevelopment plan.Other rides at the park in the early seasons included the Mercury Capsule Skyride, a monorail ride that rode about 80 feet above the Boardwalk, and the Neptune Diving Bells, a submarine that plunged passengers into a 50,000 gallon tank where they could watch a pair of porpoises and fish swim by, and the Double Sky Wheel, a double-ended Ferris wheel. A third iconic attraction at the park, the Tower to the Stars, also still stands.In 1975, the city of New York contracted with Dewey Albert to take over operation of the Cyclone roller coaster, which was across the street from the park. Eventually, the Alberts would buy the Cyclone from the city. The historic coaster is still owned and operated by the Alberts, though the land on which it stands is owned by the city.That same summer, a fire destroyed the restaurant, arcade and a number of midway games. The fire turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Astroland. With the frontage of the park destroyed, the amusements and rides were visible from the street and Astroland attracted a whole new generation of visitors.In 2006, Astroland was bought by a developer with plans to redevelop the entire Coney Island waterfront and restore many of the amusement parks. The Alberts' agreement with Thor Equities called for the amusement park to remain open and in operation through the end of the 2007 season. A second deal was negotiated at the end of the 2007 season, allowing Astroland to open for one final season in 2008. The park closed permanently on September 7, 2008.The Albert family continues to own and operate the Cyclone, across the street from the original Astroland. The Cyclone, which may be the single most famous roller coaster in the world, is open daily from noon to 9 p.m. throughout the summer. Cyclone riders can have their pictures taken at the top of the first hill as a souvenir. For more information about the Cyclone and Astroland, call the park at 718-265-2100."

The island covers 172 acres of land and sees more than 100,000 people who visit the monument on a yearly basis. Governor's Island is one of the latest monuments to be established and was designated in 2001. Later, in 2003, Governor's Island was sold and transferred to the Secretary of Interior and the Governor's Island Preservation and Education Corporation. The Governor's Island Preservation and Education Corporation which is commonly referred to as GIPEC was formed by the state of New York to manage and preserve the historical integrity of the land that once served as a military base. Visitors now frequent the island for its history. The history of Governor's Island spans for more than two centuries.

Fort Jay was constructed in 1806 and dominates much of the island. The Castle Williams fort was constructed a year after Fort Jay in 1807, and is an enormous tri-level masonry fort. The walls of the Castle Williams were eight feet creating an impenetrable layer against coastal attacks. The interior of Castle Williams has been remodeled over the years. The two structures played a prominent role in the American Civil War and the Renaissance. It was the commanding headquarters for the military post for the United States Army for more than two hundred years. The United States Coast Guard's most complex and largest base was located on Governor's Island.

New York,New York Beach Popular with Locals,"Rockaway Beach is a place filled with memories from the locals, as well as a destination for those traveling to New York. It is located in the Borough of Queens on the South Shore. The beach is operated by the city park and recs department, and was once called the Irish Rivera due to the large population of Irish-American immigrants who settled in the area.The neighborhood was once two separate villages known as Holland and Hammels. When the neighborhoods merged in 1878, they became known as Rockaway Beach. The early 1900's saw the opening of a railroad station which allowed people to visit the amusement parks, stores, and hotels that had popped up all over the area. Rockaway was sometimes known as ""New York's Playground'', partially lending its nickname to the amusement park built in 1901 called Rockaways' Playland.During the mid-1900's, the area continued to grow and added bridges, creating a gateway to the Queen's area. It soon grew into a commuter town. A major player in the town, a man whose construction dreams both enhanced and destroyed parts of Rockaway, Robert Moses created a variety of recreational facilities and areas including the Jones Beach State Park and the Coney Island Aquarium. He was responsible in many ways for luring tourist back to the area and following the 1950's, there was a bit of an urban renewal. It was the building of the Hammel Houses that truly launched this resurgence in popularity. The Hammel Houses were built on land owned by the New York City Housing Authority. These were 13 story buildings that were built close to the beach. The town was now filled with surfside housing which attracted both buyers and renters to the area. These buildings can be seen today on the shorefront, reminding beach goers of the areas rich history.Aside from being a popular tourist and beachcomber destination, Rockaway Beach has held its own in the land of entertainment. The punk rock group The Ramones have a song titled Rockaway Beach and the beach was also referenced in a Dire Straits song. Woody Allen filmed Radio Days on location at the beach and the late off-color comedian George Carlin has stated he was conceived at a beachside hotel. The beach has also been referenced more recently in televisions shows such as Seinfeld and The Nanny. Perhaps most famously, the beach is mentioned in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick.Perhaps what Rockaway Beach is most well-known for would be viewed by many as a detriment. While people can plan beach getaways to the Caribbean or Mexico and enjoy floating in pristine, crystal clear blue waters, those vacation will never full encapsulate the family feel of a beach like Rockaway. Seeped in New York lure, but also reeking of its seedy underbelly, this beach is a must see for all who travel to the area, and for anyone who wants to recapture a bit of their seaside memories, albeit a bit cloudy. Located in the Borough of Queens, Rockaway is a slice of Americana."

The center pours millions of dollars into its exhibits in order to educate the public about space travel and its history. The Johnson Space Center also has a theatre that is an excellent place to learn about the history of space ship equipment and gives in-depth details of the risk being taken by the people who have made the voyage into space. The Space Center theatre is designed for children who have a dream of being an astronaut when they grow up. Children and adults interested in working with or for Nasa are encouraged to visit Space Center Houston to have a comprehensive look of what it takes to be an astronaut or work in the center.One of the most interesting things about the Johnson Space Center is the various tours that are offered to visitors. The Space Center offers a ""Level 9 Tour."" The Level 9 Tour is the most in-depth and detailed tour offered to visitors at the center. The Level 9 is a four-five hour tour that allows visitors to infiltrate the work areas of the astronauts for Nasa. Visitors are offered an opportunity to see the observation cat walk, the vacuum chamber, take a peak into famous control rooms and eat a lunch at the astronaut's cafeteria for free. Because of the tour's popularity, admission is only received on a first-come, first serve basis. Visitors who plan on participating in the Level 9 Tour are advised to book ahead because there are only 12 slots for the Level Nine Tour per day.Blast off theatre offers IMAX type films that give visitors a small taste of what it would be like to enter space. The Astronaut Gallery is a another major attraction in the space center that offers an exhibit of the world's best spacesuit collection and a brief history lesson is taught in the clearly displayed pictures of every U.S. astronaut that has ever left for space. The Star Ship gallery is an extension of the astronaut gallery and is an exhibit for space capsules. The entire Johnson Space Center is full of many exciting exhibits that are both interactive and informational. The center is designed so that any age-level can fully enjoy the exhibits while learning about science. Distance educational programs are also available through Space Center Houston."
Houston,JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston,"The JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston is comparable to the Sears Towers in its height and achievement of being one of the tallest buildings in the world. The towering skyscraper is located at 600 Travis street and was built in 1981. JPMorgan Chase Tower was originally named the Texas Commerce Tower. The building is an overwhelming tower of gray stainless steel and glass. Most skyscrapers have four sides but the JPMorgan Chase Tower has five sides which makes it unique and brands it as the tallest five-sided building in the world. The building is also connected to the city's downtown tunnel system. The tunnel system consist of subterranean pedestrian walkways that link twenty-five blocks together.The building was designed by architect Leoh Ming Pei, a Chinese-American architect who is considered the guru of modernist building designs. Leoh Ming Pei, also known as I. M. Pei, is famous for building the Bank of China Tower located in Hong Kong and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. The Chase tower was not built alone by I. M. Pei. The architect had help from 3D International with the construction and design. Although the architects of the tower were particularly careful to ensure the tower would be one of the tallest in the world and unique, the engineering of the elevator system was also well-planned as well. The elevators run incredibly quickly and it only takes visitors 60 seconds to go from floor one to sixty. The structural stability of the JPMorgan Chase Tower was greatly tested in the summer of 2008 when Hurricane Ike destroyed glass panels on the lower half of the building. As of 2009 the building is still undergoing repairs.The JPMorgan Chase Tower has a host of amenities such as restaurants, side walk cafes, and of course the banking center. The main restaurant in the tower is Ninfa's Cantina which specializes in Mexican dishes like fajitas, tacos, and enchiladas. The Alonti Cafe is also located in the building and is used as a catering service to the different corporations who lease space in the JPMorgan Chase Tower. There are two sidewalk cafes at the tower; Starbucks and Sweet Retreat.Because of its historic height tourists frequent the building to get a view of Houston from the observation deck which is located on the 60th floor. Visitors are offered a panoramic view of the Houston skyline from the observation deck. Visitors are able to see as far as twenty miles on a clear day from the deck. The observation deck also serves as a transfer point to those who desire to reach floors 49-75. The observation deck (also called the sky box) holds paintings from the famous Joan Miro, a Spanish painter and sculptor from Spain whose painting represented Surrealism. There is also a 55-foot sculpture by the artist overlooking the plaza of the JPMorgan Chase Tower. The statue is brightly colored, abstract and whimsical. Joan Miro's presence in the observation deck and at the front of the tower gives the JPMorgan Chase Tower a touch of culture and elegance."
Houston,The Kingwood Neighborhood in Texas; Planned Community with Wide Open feel,"The Kingwood neighborhood in Texas is a planned community that is located on a major highway about twenty-five minutes away from Houston. The community currently has 65,000 residents and plans to stop building when there are 70,000 full time residents. There are three developments currently being built in the community, Kingwood, Oakhurst, and Kings Manor. There are many affordable homes that begin at $150,000 dollars, but there also some very high end homes that will cost more than $1,000,000. As you can see there will be a broad spectrum of potential buyers in the area.Kingwood is divided in neighborhoods and each neighborhood will supply specific services to its residents. Kingwood operates its own schools and libraries including a community college. The Kingwood subdivisions are called villages in the community and each village has its own community pool and recreation center. This allows the neighbors to have a central attraction which promotes community living.The Kingwood development is unique in that it is dependant upon Houston for many services such as police, fire, and emergency medical, but it is clearly not part of the City of Houston. The village pools, for instance, are not open to people who do not live in the community.Kingwood is located in a desirable location because it is close enough to Houston to make city living an easy task, but far enough away to escape many of the problems associated with living in the city. There is relatively little crime in Kingwood, it has one of the largest country clubs in the state, and is easily accessible by Bush Intercontinental Airport. The community is actively pursuing new residents at this time and there are several homes on the market.The residents of Kingwood commute to Houston to work for the most part, but many are able to find employment without leaving the neighborhood. There are many restaurants and businesses in Kingwood and according to the Kingwood Chamber of Commerce more are being added every day. For those who do commute to Houston there are many opportunities in business, real estate, transportation, and oil industries.Kingwood is a planned community and it shows. There is relatively little traffic and the streets are laid out in an intuitive way. For a place that is just twenty minutes from Houston the Kingwood neighborhood has done a great job of avoiding the traps of big city life."
Houston,Market Square Historic District in Houston,"Two brothers, Augustus and John Allen arrived from New York to Galveston in 1831. Five years later the brothers saw the great potential of the bayou and land located North of Galveston. The two brothers invested heavily into the area eventually naming the place Houston. The Market Square Historic District is considered the spot where the Allen Brothers founded Houston. Within several years of establishing the Market Square, the city of Houston begin to climb to national prominence.The Market Square Historic District in Houston sits between four streets and is the home of nightclubs, restaurants, historical buildings, bars, and much more. The Market Square Historic District has over 150 years of history that is foretold through the unique architecture, old benches, and artifacts that have weathered the years. The Market Square was the original Houston business district but over time the district transformed into an historical area where interesting architecture can be viewed. The Market Square derived its name from its roots as an open air produce market in the year 1854. The city of Houston began to grow around the center of the Market Square and over the years was recognized as a blossoming national city. Although the Market Square has maintained much of its historic legacy, the area has gone through several restoration and landscaping projects.The Market Square Historic District has places for dining and sightseeing and many of the more contemporary restaurants and places are named directly after the Market Square itself; such as the Market Square Bar and Grill; an American restaurant that serves old fashioned burgers to hungry patrons walking through the area. The Market Square Historic District is also home to La Carafe. La Carafe attests firmly to the historical value of the Market Square by being the oldest bar in the Houston area. The commercial building the bar resides in is so old that it's listed on the national register for Historic places. The worn, peeling, shadowy concrete and solid structure of the building clearly portrays the authenticity of the Market Square District.Restaurants and places like La Carafe are not the only reason tourists frequent the Market Square Historic District in Houston. The historical district also offers incredible nightlife that caters to both the older and younger crowd. The nightlife within the Historic district of Houston has some officials and residents worried that the integrity of Market Square Historic District will be compromised as it becomes a place bombarded by youth who simply want to hop from club to club. Since 1997, attempts to delay the openings of new bars and the closing of old ones has helped the city and the area regain some of its original vision for Market Square Historic District.Market Square Historic District is complete with turn of the 20th century buildings that are well preserved. The beautiful architecture that radiates from the buildings turns the district into a great sightseeing area in Houston. The buildings are built in Victorian, Art-Deco, and Beaux Arts styles. It was at the Market Square that the city of Houston dedicated its first public monument."
Houston,Memorial Park in Houston,"Memorial Park is located near the heart of downtown and is a favorite outdoor venue of many local Houston residents. The park is one of the largest urban getaways and offers many recreational opportunities. The park is rich in history and considered a lush urban gem by many. The majority of Memorial Park is located on the former grounds of a World War I facility called Camp Logan. The camp was used to train thousands of soldiers in the early 1900's. Eventually the camp was purchased by a family named the Hoggs, and in 1925, the City of Houston purchased the land from the family, transforming the space into a park. To honor the park's original history, the park was dedicated to the soldiers who lost their lives in World War I and named Memorial Park. Today, the park is over 1500 acres of wooded land, and is unique due is its location, size, and preservation of natural features. It is the 55th largest city park in the United States and in 2009, the park was said to have an estimate value of one billion dollars.The city of Houston is so enamored with Memorial Park that millions of dollars have been poured into upkeep and improvements to the park over the years. In early 2008, the mayor of Houston pledged to give the park an additional ten million dollars in funding to add even more amenities to Memorial Park over the upcoming years. Some of the amenities that the park currently has includes a fitness center, swimming pool, tennis center, infantry woods, picnic loop, baseball fields, soccer fields, and acres of beautiful gardens for nature or people-watching. The Memorial Park Picnic Loop is a multi-purpose trail that is open to roller skaters and road bikers. Mountain bikers have their own off-road trails that offer challenging terrain with ravines and slopes for an exciting ride. Most of the trails for mountain bikers are located in the southwest portion of Memorial Park. An advanced trail for mountain bikers is called the Infantry Woods and is designed for those with advanced bike handling skills and strength.An indoor gym is also located on park premises. The Memorial Park Fitness Center is situated in the middle of the park and open year round to the public. Daily or monthly use of the fitness gym requires a small fee. The gym is equipped with free-weight and resistance equipment and has shower facilities as well.There are a few educational facilities located on the premises of Memorial Park. The Houston Arboretum and Nature Center is located in the western portion of the park and was the first nature education facility in Texas. Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, which is owned by the Museum of fine arts can also be found on the grounds of the park, and the Hogg Bird Sanctuary is also technically a part of Memorial Park.In order to preserve the integrity and beauty of Memorial Park, the Memorial Park Conservancy organization was formed. The Conservatory consists of 35 members who work with the Houston Parks and Recreation Department and other organizations to offer a wide range of activities at the park as well as preserve the natural habitat of Memorial Park. Four million locals and tourists visit Memorial Park every year and play a part in the recreational, fitness, and nature communities within the park."
Houston,Midtown - Trendy and Pedestrian Friendly in Houston,"Horizontal image showing a Houston, Texas, Metro, passenger train going through an intersection. Office buildings, street lights, cars and a bricked road surface are all part of this sceneThe Midtown Neighborhood in Houston is a lesson in redevelopment. Since the beginning of the 20th century, it has morphed from a thriving residential neighborhood to a thriving commercial district and now it is a popular mixed-use neighborhood.Sometimes called ""Little Saigon'' because it once was home to a large Asian population, Midtown is now occupied by young professionals and families who enjoy the convenience of the neighborhood. Many residents enjoy the active lifestyle that is promoted by the walk-or-bike-everywhere philosophy.In the early 1900's, Midtown became the second residential neighborhood in Houston. Most of those who lived in Midtown were the families of those who had founded the Humble Oil and Refinery Company. With a decline in oil production later in the century, the neighborhood began to decline as well .A walk through Midtown today, however, would leave a visitor in doubt that it was ever anything but a hip and thriving community. There are modest apartments and luxury condos in Midtown. There are also abundant dining choices as well as shopping.Thanks to the Midtown Redevelopment Authority, the neighborhood continues to be improved upon and beautified through projects such as the addition of sidewalks, streetlights, a park and even a technology center.Additional improvement projects are completed by the Midtown Management District, which collects an assessment from both residential and commercial residents and uses those funds for marketing, public safety and service and maintenance projects. Some of the projects completed by this group include the purchase of bikes for use by the police department, opening a storefront police precinct in the neighborhood, the addition of street signs as well as several marketing efforts aimed at improving the image of the Midtown neighborhood.One of those marketing efforts was the creation of a Midtown newspaper, appropriately titled ""The Midtown Paper.''  The paper allows for the distribution of positive news about the area and provides a venue for local businesses to advertise directly to their target audience of Midtown residents.Because of the neighborhoods close proximity to Houston's medical centers and the financial district as well as all of the amenities that are within walking distance, many Midtown residents rarely need to drive. When residents do need to leave Midtown, there is an excellent public transportation system in place as well as easy access to the interstate .For many Houston residents, Midtown offers the best of both worlds: a close-knit community with big city amenities."
Houston,Minute Maid Park in Houston,"Since the famous Astrodome extracted the Houston Astros from their shelter of over thirty-five years, the Minute Maid Park has taken the Astros in and provided them with a new home to play baseball. Minute Maid Park in Houston does more than host baseball games. The Union Station ball park is also famous for hosting a variety of other events as well such as concerts and conventions. Minute Maid Park is located in the northeast portion of downtown Houston and in close proximity to the famous George R. Brown Convention Center. The park is capable of seating 42,000 visitors and occupies 29 acres of land.The Minute Maid Park in Houston opened in 2000 and was a substantial change from the Houston's former ballpark home that was in an enclosed dome with artificial grass. Minute Maid Park's real grass and open clear skies were immediately accepted by Houstonians and fans attended the first game held there in record numbers. Over three million fans attended in the 2000 season and the park has seen an estimated six million visitors since its doors opened.The Minute Maid Park was named after a Coca-Cola Product. It was given the name to honor the Coca-Cola Company for its heavy involvement in the construction and completion of the multimillion dollar baseball park. Coca-Cola's hundred million dollar investment in the park enabled them the rights to name the stadium for a length of twenty-eight years.The innovate retractable roof which only takes 12-20 minutes to open and close over the park allowed open-air baseball to played again in the city of Houston. The classic architecture of the stadium marks it as a ballpark that will move into history as one of Houston's future historic structures. The new stadium has literal ties to the past with its connection to Union Station. In the early 1900's, Houston's largest industry was composed of the railroad system . The railroads established the economic base for the metropolitan city that Houston is today. The Union Station transports baseball and concert fans into the stadium via a modern railway system.The designers of Minute Maid Park in Houston wanted a retro look to the theme park that would complement the timeless architecture of the structure. Six thousand retro green seats and panoramic views of the ballpark give the look and feel of an old time park that is newly renovated. The retractable roof on the Minute Maid Park dome comes in handy on particularly hot days because Houston is known for temperatures that exceed one hundred degrees in the summer. Visitors to Minute Maid Park give the park rave reviews for the physical comfort that the retractable roof provides and boast about clean bathrooms and easy flowing lines at concession stands. Great food, drinks, and atmosphere keeps Astros fans coming back to Minute Maid Park. The state of the art Minute Maid Park doesn't just bring in pleased fans but it also revitalizes a downtown area of Houston that has suffered tremendously due to ongoing construction projects."
Houston,Museum of Fine Arts in Houston,"The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston opened its doors to the public in 1924.

There is also an incredible collection of drawings and prints at the Museum of Fine Arts. The Prints and Drawings collection covers five hundred years of art history, many of the works being European. The collection is affectionately referred to as ""Five centuries of masterpieces on paper.""One of the most interesting things about the Museum of Fine Arts, is its film exhibition program. The Museum of Fine Arts Films was created for moviegoers who have an appreciation for both contemporary and classic films. The museum holds events such as screenings and premiers of the latest independent productions. Scholars and movie critics often make appearances to share their perspectives about different films with the audience. The Museum of Fine Arts Films has become such a big success over the years that it received the ""2008 Outstanding Award for Film Programming"" from the Houston Film Critics Society. A Cafe is also located near the films section so that film buffs can enjoy both dinner and a movie.The museum's library, Hirsch, has one of the largest collections of art references in the Southwest. The library is open to the public and includes periodicals and books on fine art, photography, and decorative art. The Hirsch Library is very technically advanced and offers on-line access to subscription databases for research. The library is located in the Caroline Weiss Building on museum premises.

In October 2000, Reliant Energy purchased the naming rights to the stadium that was to be built and named it Reliant Stadium. The stadium was designed by HOK Sport, which is the world's leading sports architecture firm. The firm designed the stadium to embody Houston's vision and the sense of adventure that is prevalent in Texas. The aim of the stadium was to have a high-tech, futuristic look that would provide an open-air feel to the thousands of people that gathered there.

Houston,"Rice University Art Gallery, Houston, TX","Museums and art galleries are a wonderful way to learn about a culture, heritage, and modern times. The Rice University Art Gallery in Houston, Texas is located in the Houston Museum District. However, this art gallery is unlike any other in the United States. It commissions site specific art. Five times each year the gallery will invite an artist. This artist is to design a room sized piece of art that will transform the gallery space. The artists can be students, famous artists, or little known artists. The idea is to give the local community something to look forward to each year, at various times of the year.Rice Gallery is located at Sewall Hall on 6100 Main Street. Hours of operation are Tuesday through Saturday 11am to 5pm,though the gallery stays open until 7pm on Thursdays and opens Sunday from noon to 5pm. Rice Art Gallery is closed on Mondays. Admission into the gallery is free, and all public are encouraged to attend. For those who are in the Houston area the Rice University Art Gallery can be part of the top destinations one must visit.This concept was created in 1995, and since then they have had more than 40 different artists and work. Much of the artists works are contemporary art. Each year they draw about 40,000 visitors from around the globe and most particularly from the USA. The concept of the design allows you to move through the art. The building set up is such that you do not mingle with others over a painting, but experience the piece designed.Since the exhibits change five times a year it is hard to name what one will see on a visit to the gallery. However, for 2010 El Anatsui Gli is on display until March 14th, 2010. El Anatsui is a native of Ghana. The artist resided in Nigeria from 1975 to the present working with wood, ceramics, and paint. Anatsui is a respected artist and teacher of Africa, and ten years ago became known in the USA.Slated for April to August 2010 is artist Andrea Dezso. The work of art Dezso will be creating is not discussed, nor is there information from the Art Gallery on the artist. An artist from a past exhibit was Wayne White. He created Big Lectric Fan to Keep Me Cool While I Sleep in 2009. As an artistic piece it was certainly interesting. It was an old man's head, lying as if in sleep with a mechanical mouth.El Anatsui has created a large wall that moves through the space. It looks like sandstone, with doors in parts, but mostly it is the weaving of bottle caps and other objects that makes the artist's rendering something to examine. For a visitor the Rice University Art Gallery is something to see because of the changing art. One may not like what is on display or it may be something that will not leave the mind."

Houston,The Astrodome,"The Astrodome which at one time was called the eighth wonder of the world, is best known for being the home of the Houston, Astros baseball team. The Astrodome is the brain child of former Houston Mayor, Roy Hofheinz who loved baseball. The inspiration for the Astrodome came to Mayor Roy Hofheinz while visiting the Coliseum in Rome. The mayor wanted to bring baseball to Houston in an enclosed venue so that bad or strange weather occurrences would not interrupt a game. The Astrodome was the first ballpark with a roof propped on top of it.The Astrodome was completed in 1964 and was officially opened in April of 1965. The Astrodome covers over 9.5 acres of land and derives its name from the Baseball team that is was home to for more than thirty-five years, the Astros. One of the most famous things the Astrodome was originally known for was its two million dollar scoreboard that occupied more than 470 feet of space. The scoreboard was eventually taken away to enhance the amount of seating options available.The Astrodome was named for the prominent role that the city of Houston played in the country's space program. Eventually the Houston Baseball Team which was initially named The Colt 45s was renamed for the dome and took on the name the Astros. The very first game played by the Astros was against the Yankees who were defeated. At the time, people across the country were so fascinated by the structure of the Astrodome over 47,000 fans attended the first game including President Lyndon B. Johnson and the First Lady.The structure of the Astrodome is amazing in and of itself. The dome is more than eighteen stories tall and has solid structural integrity created with steel triangle bars. Engineers of the Astrodome bragged that the air conditioning system was so overwhelming powerful they could produce snow within the dome under certain conditions. Most importantly, it was the the Astrodome that led to the ingenuous invention of astroturf. Astroturf is a supernaturally green artificial grass that doesn't require any mowing. The invention of astroturf was such a success that it is still currently being used in sports facilities around the United States and Europe.Because The Astrodome ushered in the area of indoor sports stadiums it stands in Houston as a historic building, mostly unused as of 2009. Unfortunately, the splendor that was once the Astrodome has been overshadowed by the Reliant Energy Stadium which boast of newer technology such as a retractable roof.  Although the dome is currently not occupied two possible plans of reconstruction are underway. There are two plans currently underway. One plan intends to turn the Astrodome into a 1,300 room luxury hotel. The second plan is encouraging the use of The Astrodome as a movie production studio. In spite of the elaborate plans to make use of the 9 acre unused dome, The Astrodome will continue to go down as a historic structure with multiple uses and changes throughout the years."

Houston,"The Toyota Center: Basketball, Hockey and Concerts in Houston","The Toyota Center, home of the Houston Rockets basketball team and the Houston Aeros hockey team, was completed in 2003 at a cost of $202 million. The Center is also home to a women's basketball team, The Houston Comets, and several concerts and other events are held at the stadium each year.Named after the Toyota car company, the indoor arena can seat up to 19,000 fans, depending on the type of event. For fans looking for something a little more luxurious than the standard stadium seats, luxury boxes are available for rent for most concerts and games. The luxury suites provide a comfortable, private and, perhaps, quieter place to take in the game. A full menu is also available which is served in the suite. The ultimate in luxury is the Penthouse Suite, but that luxury comes at a price.

From the more traditional, such as the many art museums, to offerings that truly have a Texas flavor, such as the American Cowboy Museum, Houston boasts of having 7 million visitors to its museums each year .The city also has abundant fine dining, cultural activities, shopping, performing arts and a rich nightlife. While visiting to see a game at the Toyota Center or another of the city's stadiums, there are plenty of other activities to do and places to see while in town."

Los Angeles,"Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California","Angel Stadium is located at 2000 E Gene Autry Way, in Anaheim, California. Angel Stadium was originally called Anaheim Stadium until 1997, and later Edison International Field of Anaheim until 2003.  The ballpark is a modern style stadium and home of Major League Baseball team the Los Angeles Angels, and previously the Los Angeles Rams football team. The stadium is often referred to by its unofficial name, The Big A.Construction on the park began and ground was broken on August 31st, 1964, the stadium was officially opened to the public on April 16th, 1966. The stadium is owned by the City of Anaheim and operated by Angels Baseball LP. The cost of building the stadium was originally $24 million and the park underwent extensive renovations at a cost of $118 million, between 1997 and 1999.The stadium was built on a 160 acre parcel of land and has been the home of the Angels since their move from Los Angeles, California. Angel Stadium was built on a portion of land that had once been used for agricultural purposes in the southeast portion of Anaheim. The overall dimensions of the stadium came from a scientific study done by the Angels. The team attempted to formulate dimensions that would balance the weather conditions between the pitcher and hitter.Angel Stadium was designed by the HOK Sport architectural firm and renovations were done by Disney Imagineering. The stadium has a total seating capacity of 45,050 people and has a grass playing surface.

Los Angeles,Quirky Venice Beach Shows Colorful Side of Southern California,"Palm Trees at Venice Beach, Southern CaliforniaRecently featured in the book FunkyTowns USA by Mark Cramer, Venice Beach is one of Southern California's most unique oceanfront towns. Situated in western Los Angeles, this sunny stretch of sand has been a resort since 1905, when tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney strived to make the area ""The Coney Island of the Pacific.''Co-owner of the existing Ocean Park Casino and Resort, Kinney envisioned the area south of the casino as a ""Venice of America'', complete with canals and gondolas, plenty of amusement rides, and hotels and other buildings constructed in grand Venetian style. After winning the land in a coin toss with his partners, Kinney hired workers to begin construction on the 70-foot-wide, .5 mile long Grand Canal, smaller canals, and one of the largest amusement piers in the world, measuring 900 feet long and 30 feet wide. The Los Angeles Pacific Trolley Line was to bring visitors to the area and, after a few setbacks, the newly-christened Venice Beach opened to guests on July 4, 1905.During the next few years, Kinney added a number of new attractions including a roller skating rink, a dance hall, and a heated indoor saltwater ""plunge.'' In 1909, the Venice Aquarium opened and eventually would become the marine biology station for the nearby University of Southern California. Scenic railroads, carousels, Ferris wheels, and other rides also appeared on Kinney's Pier and soon Venice Beach's popularity warranted the building of another pier - Fraser's Million Dollar Pier - which later burnt down but was rebuilt.The beach resort continued to thrive despite Prohibition and Abbot Kinney's death in 1920. The town of Venice was annexed to Los Angeles in 1930 and for a short time became a boom town when oil was discovered there that same year. At the site, 148 wells were built, producing 40,000 gallons of oil each day.Times were lean during the Depression, with beach outings dwindling to almost nothing. But the onset of World War II in 1941 saw Venice Beach assume a different role as a daytime entertainment destination for soldiers and sailors on weekend leave from nearby military bases and shipyards. In 1946, however, the lease expired on Kinney's Pier and the city of Los Angeles chose to tear it down. Ocean Park Pier, however, remained open until 1967.The 60s ushered in a decade of decay for Venice Beach. By the late part of the decade, it had become a haven for those associated with the Beat movement and later was popular with Southern California's hippies. Bands like The Doors were the epitome of Venice culture and performed often for excited crowds. Pot parties on the canals were common. However, though life in Venice during that time wasn't always peaceful, the counterculture brought a uniqueness to this beach area that still exists today.In the 1970s, the city of Los Angeles began to take steps to reinvigorate the oceanfront area, adding an oceanfront walk and an 18-mile-long bicycle path. When the inline skate was introduced in the late 70s, the wide bicycle path became popular with skaters and remains so today. That same decade brought artists, street vendors, body builders, and street entertainers to the area, and this colorful seaside destination began attracting more than locals, with new visitors providing a financial boost to the area.Today, street performers are everywhere, entertaining crowds with everything from singing and dancing to juggling and telling jokes. Artists of all genres are part of Venice Beach's world-famous Art Walk, which features galleries, art studios, and easels set up along the ocean walk. A few of the original canals still exist and are now lined with multi-million dollar upscale homes that are among the most beautiful in Los Angeles County."
Los Angeles,Beverly Wilshire Beverly Hills - Los Angeles - Luxury Epitomized,"In an area renowned for its high end living, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, located on the southern end of Rodeo Drive, represents the crown jewel of Beverly Hills. Completed in 1928, the former Beverly Wilshire Apartment Hotel has become a luxurious home away from home for celebrities and non-celebrities alike. Famous for more than just its locale, the Beverly Wilshire has played host to everyone from the Dalai Lama and Elvis Presley, to several U.S. Presidents and yes, even a ""pretty woman"" or two.The Beverly Wilshire Hotel is actually situated on the former site of the Beverly Auto Speedway, which was a popular gathering place to watch Ford Model T's race across Beverly Hills during the Roaring Twenties. Before the arrival of the hotel, there was little to attract people's attention in the direction of Beverly Hills, especially with Hollywood being so close. For the most part, the area consisted of dirt roads and bean fields.The hotel's arrival, along with a migration of movie stars, changed the face of Beverly Hills forever. Today, Beverly Hills would seem incomplete without the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, which offers its guests an incomparable level of luxury. Among the hotels amenities and services are a spa and fitness center, an Olympic-sized pool, award-winning dining, and several programs and services designed specifically for children. At one point, championship tennis courts were built and headed by Pancho Gonzalez, a tennis pro considered by many to have been the best tennis player of his or any generation.Despite the fact that the hotel has changed hands several times, including 1940, 1958, 1961, 1985, and 1992, its goal of maintaining its status never has. Since its opening in 1928, more than $135 million have been spent on upgrades, renovations, and maintenance. In all, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel consists of two wings, the Beverly Wing and the Wilshire Wing, both of which are connected by a domed carriage porch. The Wilshire Wing alone cost a reported $4 million to construct, and contains Corinthian columns, Tuscany stone, mosaic skylights, and rooftop gardens. There are 395 deluxe rooms in the hotel, 120 of which are pool-side suites.Of course, the hotel's Wilshire Wing also features a very famous 4,000 square foot, $5000 a night Presidential Suite that was occupied by Julia Roberts' character in the movie Pretty Woman. If that is not enough the hotel's Beverly Wing is home to a 5,000 square foot Penthouse Suite that will run guests about $7,500 a night, and contains a wrap-around balcony, an Italian marble bathtub, glass chandeliers, and Roman columns throughout.Like many of the people who live in Beverly Hills, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel continues to defy its age. Today, the hotel remains as popular as ever, attracting royalty from Hollywood and from around the world. With its location so close to the famous Rodeo Drive shops and eateries, the Beverly Wilshire is truly a place to see and be seen. There is no need to be a star to come out of the hotel feeling like one."
Los Angeles,"Bradbury Building - Los Angeles, California - Downtown LA Landmark and Movie Site","One of downtown Los Angeles's enduring landmarks is the Bradbury Building, a unique, five-story piece of architecture on the corner of Broadway and Third that was built in 1893. Although it is often alluded to as representative of 19th century Art Nouveau style, the building's design is perhaps better described as ""Eclectic Victorian Pre-Modern.''Commissioned by local property millionaire and mining tycoon Lewis Bradbury in 1889, the Bradbury Building is the creation of George H. Wyman, a draftsman with no formal architectural or engineering training. Wyman's unusual design was accepted when local architect Sumner Hunt failed to create a plan matching the millionaire's vision for a spectacular office block.Completion of the project required four years of construction and an investment of $500,000. Unfortunately, Bradbury passed away a few months before his building's grand opening and never had the opportunity to witness the iconic role it would play in the architectural heritage of downtown Los Angeles.What is particularly fascinating about the Bradbury Building is the contrast between its exterior and interior facades. From the outside, it is a rather heavy, common-looking, brick and sandstone commercial office structure with inset storefronts, paired rectangular windows on the upper floors, and arched brownstone Romanesque entryways. Inside, however, it is a very different world - an enriched and leisurely space that is isolated from the hustle of the surrounding streets.The building's airy courtyard is a ""cobweb of cast iron'' featuring delicate ornamentation and topped with a glass roof. When flooded with natural light, the glazed brick walls of the inner court sparkle with an unearthly quality. Art Nouveau iron work was used exclusively for the marble stairways, open hydraulic elevator cages, and balcony rails. Architecturally, the exposed iron, glass and glazing components are a lineal descendant of Labrouste's Bibliotheque Nationale of 1858 and Eiffel's Bon Marche department store of 1876. In the early 1990s, the building underwent complete restoration as part of the Yellin Company's Grand Central Square project.Not surprisingly, numerous Hollywood directors have chosen the Bradbury Building as a location for shooting their movies. It is perhaps most famous for its appearance in Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction movie ""Blade Runner'' as the fictional home of genetic designer J.F. Sebastian. The structure also appeared in Orson Welles' 1941 film classic ""Citizen Kane'' and has more recently been used in such Hollywood productions as Chinatown, Double Indemnity, and Lethal Weapon 4.Today, the Bradbury Building stands as the oldest commercial building remaining in the central city. In 1971, it was officially listed on National Register of Historic Places. It has been designated by the city as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #6. And in 1997 and 1998, the Building Owners and Managers Association presented the building's custodians with the BOMA Award for Excellence in Management.The Bradbury Building is located at 304 South Broadway, Los Angeles, California 90013-1224. It is roughly 18 miles, or about 25 minutes, from Los Angeles International Airport. To get there, take the I-105 Freeway East toward Norwalk. After 6.5 miles, merge onto the I-110 Freeway North to the Fourth Street Exit 22B. From the ramp, exit left onto Fourth Street at Exit 23B. Turn left onto Broadway and the Bradbury Building can be seen directly ahead at the corner of Third Street."

Los Angeles,"California Science Center - Los Angeles, CA - Where Science and Fun Collide","Situated on the site of the former State Exposition Building that was erected in 1921, the California Science Center, whose doors opened in 1998, has become the pride of Los Angeles' Exposition Park, which had long been the home of the California Museum of Science and Industry.The California Science Center opened in 1998 after ten years of planning and development. The site, which is only one-third of the way completed in accordance with its master plan, currently features two permanent exhibition spaces, as well as two additional galleries dedicated to temporary and traveling exhibitions. The two permanent exhibition spaces, appropriately titled World of Life and Creative World, are dedicated to biological life processes and invention and innovation respectively.The World of Life space currently focuses on five biological processes, including reproduction and the function of the immune system.

When the third phase is completed, the California Science Center will eventually be the largest science center in the western United States."
Los Angeles,"Carole and Barry Kaye Museum of Miniatures - Los Angeles, California Museum Now Closed","Opened originally in August 1992 as the Petite Elite Miniature Museum and rededicated in June 1994 at a new location on bustling Wilshire Boulevard, the Carole and Barry Kaye Museum of Miniatures delighted visitors for nearly two decades. In its day, it was ""the premier miniature museum on the West Coast'' and, perhaps, in the world.Housed there were collections of exquisitely detailed miniatures representing all walks of life - a small mountain with a scale model train, a military room for replicas of soldiers from different war eras, the Kupjack 1950s diner and malt shop, and so much more. On display at one time was a recreation of the Doges Palace. One exhibit featured the six wives of Henry VIII created by renowned artist George Stuart. There was a miniature version of the Hollywood Bowl, too.All in all, hundreds of exhibits were featured over the years, many done in 1? scale with intricate detail and crafting accuracy. One of the Lilliputian works featured monogrammed flatware less than half an inch long. There were ornate tea sets that could fit on top of a dime. Toothpick artist Wayne Kusy's 10-foot-long replica of the Titanic was part of the collection, as was the Greene and Greene Craftsman Bungalow and the Golden Train from Copenhagen with its little cargo of rubies and emeralds by dollhouse specialists Pat and Noel Thomas.Curator Carole Kay developed the museum and its retail shop along with her husband Barry, a real estate planner, as a natural offshoot of her interest in miniature art. After building a dollhouse for her grandson in 1990, she gradually grew her hobby into a business, commissioning dollhouses by several artists. Prior to the museum's opening, Kaye told the Los Angeles Times, ""I got carried away. It became an obsession. We just kept collecting (miniatures).''The museum expanded into its 14,000-square-foot space at 5900 Wilshire Boulevard after outgrowing the initial 3,800-square-foot property it occupied in Century City next to Barry Kaye's office. Before that, the Kayes' home housed the dollhouses and miniatures to overflowing. Although they owned most of the pieces displayed, others were exhibited on loan.Today, however, the Carole and Barry Kay Museum of Miniatures and its retail shop are now closed. What remained of the permanent collection was donated in 2009 to the Naples Museum of Art at the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, 5833 Pelican Bay Boulevard, Naples, Florida 34108-2740."
Los Angeles,"Chinatown - Los Angeles, California - L.A.'s Hub for Chinese Culture and Food","The first Chinese settlement in Los Angeles appeared in 1852, near what is now Union Station. Some 86 years later, the ""Old Chinatown'' community resettled a few streets over, dedicating its Central Plaza on June 25, 1938. Thus did this area become America's very first modern Chinatown, owned, planned and developed exclusively by some 3,000 residents of Chinese descent.This ""New Chinatown'' consisted of restaurants, curio shops, a bean cake factory, a grocery store, a Chinese deli, an herbalist and a number of offices. The Hong buildings on Gin Ling Way were completed in 1939, along with the district's famed East Gate landmark on Broadway, also constructed by Y.C. Hong in memory of his mother.Other architectural elements and embellishments soon followed, including the Forbidden Palace and the artistic rendering known as the Seven Star Sacred Caverns with its wishing pool and willow tree. In 1941, the five tier tower of the Hop Louie-Jade Pagoda (Golden Pagoda) was added.Since January 26, 1939, the Chinese New Year has been ushered in here annually with great celebration, including fire works, lion dances, bright costumes and pageantry. The initial lighting ceremony of the East Gate took place on its first anniversary in June 1939 and was reprised in 1985, when the gate was ceremoniously refit as part of a major rehabilitation and beautification effort.Today, a walk through Chinatown is a must on every L.A. visitor's agenda. Starting from the Central Plaza at 947 North Broadway, it is easy to spend an entire day just exploring the area's quaint walkways and tiny shops.Heading south along North Broadway, you will pass curio shops and jewelry stores, beautiful tile murals and the Phoenix Bakery, Chinatown's oldest and largest bakery, which has a citywide reputation for delicious strawberry whipped cream cakes. You will want to do some window shopping at the bazaars of Saigon Plaza and Dynasty Center, where stalls are owned by ethnic Chinese immigrants from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Bargains to be found here include clothing, toys, and sundries of all kinds, as well as gold and jade jewelry items.Cathay Bank, the first Chinese American-owned bank in Chinatown, can be found at the corner of Alpine and Broadway. Nearby is the Far East Plaza, considered to be America's first modern ethnic shopping mall. It houses restaurants serving regional cuisine as well as the Wing Hop Fung Ginseng and China Products Center, the largest outlet of its kind in Los Angeles. Shop here for herbs, teas, chinaware, arts, crafts and garments. It also contains an Oriental pharmacy and an acupuncturist.Other sites to see along the way through Chinatown include the Taoist Temple filled with smoky incense, the original Chinese United Methodist Church, and the Pacific Alliance Medical Center dating back to 1868. West Plaza, which was built in the late 1940s, houses residences as well as businesses. It is home to the local avant-garde art community, whose galleries are mixed among the curio shops. And for a bit of history, take a peek inside the headquarters of the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California on Bernard Street, with its artifacts and photos recounting the history of the Chinese in Southern California.Chinatown is located on the Metro Gold Line at 901 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, California 90012-1862. The Chinatown Central Plaza is bordered by Hill Street and Broadway between College Street and Bamboo Lane. To get there by car from the Westside of L.A., take the 10 Freeway east to the 110 Freeway north, and then exit at Hill Street. Signs directing traffic to Chinatown are clearly posted. A number of open air lots and enclosed garage structures can be found in the vicinity, with day rates ranging from $3 to $8."
Los Angeles,"Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, California: A Film Landmark Not To Be Missed","The most famous theatre in the world, Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Hollywood, CaliforniaA visit to Grauman`s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles is a great visit for tourists or as part of a family outing for L.A. and Southern California residents. While young children may not remember some of the old stars, they will still enjoy placing their hands and feet in their prints along the sidewalk. Children of all ages are also awed by the extravagant adornments of the theater that were imported from China by Sid Grauman in order to build this Hollywood landmark.One cannot help but be struck on approaching this building at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard. The structure stands ninety feet tall at the entrance, with two red pillars topped in iron masks supporting the outstretched bronze roof. A huge dragon image towers above the entry, set back between the columns and two giant stone dogs sit faithfully at the foot of each one.The Chinese Theater in Los Angeles first opened on May 18, 1927. The gala opening night is said to have provoked rioting in the street as spectators pushed and shoved one another to get a glimpse of the star-studded Hollywood icons of the time. The King of Kings by epic filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille was the first film to open at the theater, which to date continues to be one of the most sought after opening venues for motion pictures.Sid Grauman had built several other lavish theaters, but this was his dream theater. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Grauman had moved west in the ""Klondike gold rush''. He owned several theaters in Alaska and the northwest prior to settling down in Southern California. The Chinese Theater in Los Angeles literally became his landmark contribution to U.S. popular culture. The theater, which took 18 months and two million dollars to build, (quite a sum at that time), was actually owned in partnership between Grauman, Howard Schenck and early picture stars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. Grauman sold his share in 1929 but stayed on as the Director of the building until his death in 1950.While the Oscar is a coveted trade prize for film actors, no award does as much to provide immortal fame to Hollywood stars nor continues to be as sought after as the opportunity to leave their marks in the cement sidewalk in the vicinity of Grauman`s Chinese Theater.Visitors can find numerous restaurants in the nearby vicinity. But don't expect an easy seat to watch the latest film. The theater continues to host studio film premieres and to attract tourists and ""star gazers'' from around the worldIn 1968, the building was registered as a historic, cultural landmark and since that time there has been ongoing restoration to maintain this Hollywood architectural icon. The famed hand and footprints associated with the theater now stretch for blocks and often attract hundreds of people so allow time for a leisurely stroll when visiting."
Los Angeles,Dodger Stadium - Los Angeles - Home of the Boys of Summer,"If Southern California is known as Dodgertown, than Dodger Stadium is its capital building. For forty-seven years, Dodger Stadium, situated in an area of Los Angeles known as Chavez Ravine, has been a home of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. The Dodgers played their first game at Dodger Stadium in 1962, after playing their games in the nearby Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.Records kept by team officials indicate that more than 125 million fans have visited Dodger Stadium since 1962. The stadium, as plain as it is beautiful, is surrounded by downtown Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the local Elysian Hills. The stadium has seats for 56,000 spectators, and parking for 16,000 automobiles. A grounds crew and a staff of gardeners help keep the field and surrounding landscape in order. Year after year, Dodger Stadium is voted among the top of the most beautiful stadiums in all of the major leagues.In its forty-seven year history, Dodger Stadium has hosted eight World Series, and has seen the Dodgers win four of those championships. The stadium has also been the site of the 1980 Major League All-Star Game, the 1984 Olympic baseball competition, and the Baseball Association World All-Star Game in 1991. In 2009, Dodger Stadium will also play host to the finals of the World Baseball Classic.Besides sporting events, Dodger Stadium has also played host to several non-sporting events. In 1987, Pope John Paul II held Mass at Dodger Stadium. Performances from KISS, The Beatles, Elton John, U2, Michael Jackson, and Bruce Springsteen have all taken place at Dodger Stadium in front of sell-out crowds. In 1994, The Three Tenors Jose Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti, and Placido Domingo held a reunion concert at Dodger Stadium.In an era of larger and fancier ballparks, Dodger Stadium's simplicity have made it a favorite place for fans and players. A tribute to its popularity is the fact that in 1978, Dodger Stadium became the first stadium to draw over 3 million visitors. The Dodgers also set the all-time attendance mark for a single season in 1982 when they drew more than 3.6 million fans. That mark has since been broken, but Dodger Stadium can still boast of having nine of the twenty-five highest single-season attendance marks.Recent years have seen the stadium undergo several improvements, upgrades, and renovations. New field level seats, expanded dugouts, and Club Level suites were added in 2000. Three years later, the stadium was given a new scoreboard and a new video board. In 2006, every seat in the stadium was replaced, thus returning the stadium to its original pastel color scheme. Field Level concession stands, restrooms, and private ""clubs"" were added for the 2008 season, and several new vendors were added to the stadium's current list including Canter's Deli, Ruby's Diner, and Camacho's Cantina.In order to help maintain the stadium's status as one of the best in all of baseball, Dodger ownership has announced an improvement and maintenance plan known as The Next 50. The Next 50 plan will eventually include a tree-lined entrance to the stadium, a promenade of shops, restaurants, and a Dodger museum, a natural perimeter to surround the stadium to be known as The Green Necklace, and an upgraded and improved Top Of The Park plaza."

Los Angeles,"Elysian Park - Los Angeles, California - large, old park in southern California","Founded in 1886, Elysian Park is the oldest park in the city of Los Angeles. It is also one of the largest parks in this city, covering around 600 acres. Elysian Park isn't just trees and ponds; it is also home to the Chavez Ravine featuring Dodger Stadium and the Los Angeles Police Academy. Much of the land in the park is comprised of rolling hills.Elysian Park began to be developed and used as a park site as early as 1769, when explores Gaspar de Portola and Father Juan Crespi camped in this area. At this time, the Yang-Na Native Americans lived in this area. When the Pueblo of Los Angeles was established in 1781, around 17,000 acres were given as a public land grant. Later, in 1849, much of this land was auctioned off, but the Elysian Park area was reserved for public use. At that time, it was called Rock Quarry Hills, but the mayor renamed it and declared it a city park in 1886. Over the decades, this park has been considered for development a number of times, but due to the charter revisions, there's a strong legal base for the park to remain protected. Friends of the park have also taken measures to establish the park's historical significance to the city.The park fully encompasses Chavez Ravine, which is the current site of Dodger Stadium. Ground was broken for this stadium in 1959, and the ballpark officially opened in 1962. This stadium is the third oldest in Major League Baseball, following only Boston's Fenway Park and Chicago's Wrigley Field. The field overlooks downtown Los Angeles and is designed to be earthquake-resistant. It has a capacity of 56,000, and it can hold slightly more fans if they sell standing-room tickets as well.Elysian Park is in a middle-class neighborhood close to downtown Los Angeles. Interstate 110, more commonly known as the Pasadena Freeway, cuts through the park using the Figueroa Street Tunnels. The park is bordered by Echo Park, Chinatown, Cypress Park, and the Elysian Valley. There is some residential development in the western portion of the park, near Echo Park's Elysian Heights quarter.Along with Dodger Stadium, the park also contains the Bishop Canyon picnic area and baseball field, the Buena Vista Meadow picnic area, the Elysian Therapeutic Center, the Solano Canyon community garden, Victory Memorial Grove (a World War I memorial), the Portola Trail historical monument, the Chavez Ravine Arboretum, the Grace E. Simons Lodge, the Johns Memorial, the Monticello De Leo Politti picnic area, Palm Hill, and the Carob Tree Grove picnic area. There's also a maintenance office, but the park is generally understaffed. Elysian Park is unlocked and open to the public daily, and those interested in supporting the park can join the Friends of Elysian Park group. Guests can also call the Elysian Park maintenance supervisor at 213-485-5054 to learn more about the area.

For 75 years, it has been a gathering point for local foodies, celebrities and area chefs. In addition to food stalls and produce markets, the Market features tourist shops, restaurants and even a service for shoe shines and footwear repair.The original Farmers Market was the brainchild of oilman Earl Bell Gilmore, the son of a dairy farmer who owned the land here known as Gilmore Island. In July of 1934, a contingent of local farmers parked their trucks on the empty property and displayed their produce on the tailgates. Enticed by fresh goods and open-air commerce, customers quickly arrived by car to stroll among the trucks purchasing vegetables, fruit, and flowers.Farmers Market almost instantly became an institution. Around it grew a mercantile community, including the Grove retail center, North Market and Gilmore Bank. By the 1940s, permanent covered stalls for the produce vendors had been created.A wonderful clock tower was erected, too. It still stands to this day as testament to ""An Idea'' that spurred the development. When the new North Market Building was added to the property in 2002, with ground level retail spaces and upper level offices, the clock tower was moved to its current location in the plaza.Today, the grocers of Farmers Market are well-known for their culinary advice as well as for their flavorful, fresh products.

Los Angeles,"Getty Villa - Pacific Palisades, California - Museum of Ancient Mediterranean Art and Culture","Constructed in the early 1970s, the Getty Villa in Malibu is an educational center and museum, created as the vision of American-born British philanthropist Sir John Paul Getty (1932~2003). Modeled after the Villa dei Papiri, a first-century Roman country house in Herculaneum, Italy, the villa is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria.The Getty Villa houses the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection of roughly 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities, objects dating from 6,500 B.C. to A.D. 400. Besides monumental sculptures, there are artifacts of everyday life, such as coins, gems, and jewelry. They have been arranged by themes, including Gods and Goddesses, Dionysus and the Theater, and Stories of the Trojan War. More than 1,200 works are on display in the 23 galleries of the permanent collection. Five additional galleries are devoted to changing exhibitions.Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg worked closely with Getty to develop the villa's original Roman-inspired interiors and exteriors. In 1997, Boston-based architects Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti undertook renovations, including the open-air Entry Pavilion and the 450-seat outdoor classical amphitheater - Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman Theater.North of the Museum is the Ranch House, where the original J. Paul Getty Museum was located. It now houses antiquities, curatorial offices, meeting rooms, and a 20,000-volume Research Library.

Some 300 varieties of plant material were used in the landscaping. Open spaces are adorned with bronze sculptures, fountains, trees, herbs and flowers that would have been familiar to the Romans of old.The Inner Peristyle with its narrow reflecting pool provides a secluded resting spot at the very center of the property. Likewise, the East Garden is a place of tranquility. There is also an herb garden just outside the Museum entrance.

Los Angeles,"The Griffith Observatory In Los Angeles, California","Building that houses one of the two telescopes in the Griffith Park Observatory as seen from late afternoonThe Griffith Observatory is situated on land that was donated to the City of Los Angeles in 1896, by Col. Griffith J. Griffith. In his will, Griffith donated money to build an exhibit site, observatory and planetarium. Construction on the Griffith Observatory began in 1933, using designs provided by architect John C. Austin and sketches by Russell W. Porter. Building was completed and the observatory was opened to the public on May 14th, 1935. In its five days alone, it welcomed over 13,000 visitors.The observatory is nestled on a slope, facing Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park, it has views of the Los Angeles Basin, downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and the Pacific Ocean, the views are breathtaking. When visitors first arrived in 1935, they encountered an exhibit of the Foucault Pendulum, which was designed to simulate the earth's rotation around the moon. The exhibit also included a Zeiss telescope, designed by 19th century German optician, Carl Zeiss. There was also a solar telescope, and a 38 ft. tall model of the moons north polar region.Col. Griffith also made another request in his will, that the observatory include an exhibit about evolution. This was accomplished by using a Cosmochron exhibit, which included a narrative and a slide show. The evolution exhibit remained a part of the observatories regular exhibits until the mid 1960's. The observatory also contained a planetarium, which covered topics like the moon, eclipses and the solar system.During World War II, the planetarium was used to train pilots for celestial navigation. It was also used to train the astronauts for the Apollo mission in the 1960's. In 2002, the observatory closed for renovation and expansion. The $93 million was just what the aging observatory needed, it reopened its doors on November 3, 2006, new and yet still retaining its original art-deco appeal. There were expansions made underground which includes new shops and exhibits, the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater, and one of the restaurants is run by famous chef Wolfgang Puck.Ever since it opened back in 1935 and even now, the Griffith Observatory has never charged a fee for admission in accordance with Griffith J. Griffith's will. Through the years the observatory has also served as a backdrop for some famous movies, such as; The Terminator, Dragnet, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Transformers, and many others. It is also featured in the movie, ""Rebel Without A Cause'', starring James Dean, and a bust of James Dean is located on the grounds. For many years, the Griffith Observatory has served as focal point in Los Angeles and it has only expanded and grown over time."

Los Angeles,"Heritage Square Museum - Los Angeles, California - A Living History of Southern California","The Heritage Square Museum is classified as a ""living history museum.'' It preserves and interprets the settlement and development of Southern California from 1850 to 1950 by offering visitors an opportunity to peek inside the homes and everyday lives of Southern Californians from the Civil War to the mid-20th Century.Eight historic structures make up the museum, each representing a different aspect of California life. They include the Carriage Barn, the Ford House, the Hale House, the Lincoln Avenue Methodist Church, the Octagon House, the Palms Depot, the Perry Residence, and the Valley Knudsen. Most were constructed during the Victorian Era and saved from the wrecking ball to be used as background in educating the public about the area's early development.Gilbert Longfellow's Octagon House dating from 1893 is one of the simpler structures, costing less to construct and requiring shorter lengths of lumber than conventional homes. Modestly furnished, it stands in stark contrast to the opulent 1876 mansion of prominent businessman and lumber baron William Hayes Perry. The Perry Residence features the original hardwood floors, sweeping staircase, and marble fireplace mantles that once adorned its location in Boyle Heights. In its day, the mansion was one of the finest and most expensive homes in Los Angeles.Even larger than the Perry Residence is the 1898 Methodist Church, which had to be cut into six pieces to move it to the museum from its original site on the southeast corner of Orange Grove Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue in Pasadena. It once served as a community center for church functions and classes.The Ford House is a typical tract-style middle-class Los Angeles home of the late 1870s. Lifted from on Mozart Street in the neighborhood of Lincoln Heights, the French-influenced Valley Knudsen Garden Residence represents a departure in middle-working class housing of the same period. Meanwhile, the Hale House is an example of Queen Anne and Eastlake styles from 1887, with elegant furnishings depicting the turn of the century.The Carriage Barn was built in 1899 to store a carriage and stable horses. The structure was later converted into a dwelling and garage. Architecturally, its three gables and distinctive pitched roof are common features of the Queen Anne Cottage style with Gothic influences.A noteworthy rail stop after it was built in 1887, the Palms Depot was declared an historical monument in 1963. It has been used in as a set for movies and television, but today the station serves as the Heritage Square Museum's Visitor Center and Store, and its platform is where guided tours begin.General admission to the Heritage Square Museum is $10 for adults, $8 for seniors over 65, and $5 for youth ages 6 to 12. Museum members and children under the age of six are admitted free of charge. Discounts are given to members of the AAA Auto Club and TimeTravelers.Guided tours of most of the structures depart hourly from noon to 3pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Group tours can be arranged on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays between 10am and 2pm. The museum's business offices are open Monday through Friday, from 9am to 4:30pm, and the museum is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day.The Heritage Square Museum is located at 3800 Homer Street, Los Angeles, California, 90031-1530. It is just off the I-110 Arroyo Seco Parkway (aka 110 Pasadena/Harbor Freeway). Exit at Avenue 43 and turn right onto Homer Street. The parking lot entrance is at the end of the street on your right."
Los Angeles,Take a Stroll down the Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Bruce Lee's star at the Hong Kong avenue of stars in the late evening hours, people walking by, motion blurredThe Hollywood walk of Fame is a tribute to some of the greatest entertainers in the history of our country. It is located in Hollywood, California and is not to be missed during any trip that takes you near the epicenter of entertainment.The Walk of Fame has been in existence since 1958 and each year the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce votes on which stars will be added. Anyone in the entertainment industry can be nominated including cartoons, corporations, and of course, stars. A little known fact of the walk of fame is that it costs $25,000 dollars, to be paid by the inductee, to be immortalized with a star.There are a couple of stars that are unique even among this honored group. Muhammad Ali did not wish that anyone step on his star so it was placed on a building along the route. The Apollo 11 astronauts all have a star to commemorate their successful lunar landing, the youngest people to receive a star were Mary Kate and Ashley Olson at the age of eighteen, and Gene Autrey is the only person to receive a star in each of the five recognized categories (Film, broadcast television, recording, radio, and live theater).The process of awarding stars can be confusing to the public. For instance Robert Redford still does not have a star, but Big Bird does. Mel Gibson is on the outside looking in, but Pee Wee Herman has his very own star. Two dogs have been immortalized on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Rin Tin Tin, and of course, Lassie.The walk of fame is a great way to spend an afternoon, but it is unlikely that you will see an actual star near the walk of fame unless it is during an induction ceremony. Hollywood is not the glamorous neighborhood that is portrayed on television.Hollywood is in a depressed area of Los Angeles. There have been sixty percent more murders so far in 2008 than there were at this time in 2007. In fact, every area of violent crime has seen an increase in 2008 (LAPD Crime Statisticshttp://www.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/hwdprof.pdf).People who live in Hollywood typically work in the entertainment, hospitality, and transportation industries. Another thing to take into careful consideration is that the traffic in Los Angeles will likely make your commute to work a lengthy one."
Los Angeles,"Hollywood Museum - Los Angeles - Movies, Magic, and More","The Hollywood Museum, considered the official museum of Hollywood, is located inside the famous Max Factor Building at 1660 North Highland Avenue. The museum's location is the site where make-up wizard Mac Factor began ""doing up"" Hollywood movie stars in 1935. Once unused, the Max Factor Building was purchased by real estate developer Donelle Dadigan from the Proctor & Gamble company in 1995 and slowly converted into the Hollywood Museum. It reportedly cost Dadigan more than $7 million to restore, repair, and stock the museum and renew it in order to help it become the home of Hollywood's movie history. Besides Dadigan, some of Hollywood's biggest and best-known names have contributed to the establishment, growth, and maintenance of the museum, including director Francis Ford Coppola, Johnny Grant, the honorary mayor of Hollywood, actress Shirley MacLaine, television personality Leonard Maltin, and producer Dino de Laurentis.Being located in the heart of Hollywood certainly has its privileges, as the museum has collected enough ""artifacts"" to boast arguably the largest and most significant collection of Hollywood movie memorabilia in the world. Few places are home to more important pieces than the Hollywood Museum. With four floors and more than 35,000 square feet of space, along with an additional floor dedicated to special events, the Hollywood Museum is home to more than ten thousand pieces of movie memorabilia.Of the museum's many possessions, some its most prized and popular include the boxing gloves from the original Sylvester Stallone movie Rocky, Marilyn Monroe's million dollar honeymoon dress, Elvis Presley's favorite bathrobe, the whip from the Indian Jones movies, and the swing from the movie Moulin Rouge. Among the many items in the museum's collection are costumes from classics like Gone With The Wind and I Love Lucy, as well as items personally owned by Tom Cruise, Marilyn Monroe, Will Smith, Charlie Chaplin, and Bob Hope.On the museum's ground floor, which includes the magnificently remodeled lobby and Max Factor make-up rooms, is a collection of thousands of vintage black and white photographs related to Hollywood's history - the largest of its kind anywhere. The ground floor is also the location of Cary Grant's personal Rolls Royce, as well as several major pieces of memorabilia from Jurassic Park and The Wizard of Oz.Costumes, props, and photos make up the contents of the second floor, which also includes a bed from the movie Gladiator and the gold Cadillac from the movie Dreamgirls. The museum's basement is a fan favorite. Once a speakeasy during the days of Prohibition, the basement is now the home of Hannibal Lecter's prison cell and his mask. Recently, the museum's basement has been used as the focal point of a Halloween attraction known as the Chamber of Horrors, which showcases memorabilia from ten of the most popular (and scary) movies of all time.In terms of size, the Hollywood Museum is measurably larger than several surrounding museums. In terms of square footage, the Hollywood Museum is more than twice as large as both the Guinness World Record Museum and the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum combined."
Los Angeles,"Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - Los Angeles, California - Hotel with a Role in Hollywood History","Positioned just off Hollywood Boulevard, the 12-story, Spanish-style Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has been a local landmark since 1927. This was where the very first Academy Awards were held in 1929. It once served as the playground for such famed celebrities as Errol Flynn, Montgomery Clift, and Marilyn Monroe. And today it continues its tradition of offering elegance and privacy to discriminating travelers under the stewardship of Thompson Hotels.Indeed, when Thompson Hotels took over ownership in 2005 and announced a sweeping redesign of the property, many were concerned that the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel would lose its allure as a Hollywood icon. But Dodd Mitchell's treatment of the hotel's 302 guestrooms has given the interior a sleek mid-century modern style while retaining its historic ambiance, including such touches as old photographs on the walls and, of course, the famed Spanish fountain in the lobby.The newly renovated Gable & Lombard Penthouse is a fine example of the hotel's dedication to privacy and comfort. It is a three-story refuge named after Carole Lombard and Clark Gable, who used to rendezvous at the Roosevelt as they pursued their rather public private affair. The Penthouse now sports a 1,000-square-foot private rooftop deck. Its arched windows stretch from floor to ceiling; its chairs were crafted by Mies Van der Rohe; and, as a strictly modern touch, it features three plasma televisions.All of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's well appointed rooms and suites have been finished with chocolate-hued wood and creamy white upholstery, and blown glass elements have been used as accents. The draped-fabric headboards are reminiscent of Roman shades. Luxurious bed and bath linens by Sferra come standard, as do bath products by Kiehl's. There are pantries stocked with Dean and Deluca snacks, too.Lower-floor units feature patios that open onto the pool. Rooms on the upper floors have balconies with tables and chairs. The tower block's east-facing double rooms overlooking Grauman's Chinese Theater are said to offer the best view.Business guests will appreciate the availability of hotel-wide high-speed WiFi access, and the audio/visual equipment is state-of-the-art. There are also a number of spacious banquet and conference rooms, in addition to the historic Blossom Room main ballroom, allowing hosting of groups for meetings and events from 15 to 1,500 persons.One of the enduring features of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is its David Hockney-designed swimming pool, which is surrounded by elegant chaise lounges and private cabanas. It was created as an oasis for the glitterati, where they could enjoy the warm California sun unencumbered by the madding crowds.Wrapped around the pool is the ever-glamorous Tropicana Bar. After dark, it transforms itself into a sultry lounge, which has attracted the attention of Hollywood's younger crowd and made it a romantic highlight of the L.A. night scene.The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's signature restaurant is the Dakota, a steakhouse open from 6pm to 10:30pm Sunday through Thursday, and from 6:30pm until 11pm on Friday and Saturday. Another on-premise choice for dining is 25 Degrees, a burger bar with leather seats and plenty of style. And for drinks, there is Teddy's Lounge, a glamorous bar till the velvet ropes go up late in the evening and it becomes one of Hollywood's hottest clubs.The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is located just minutes from the Bob Hope and Los Angeles International airports at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard., Los Angeles, California 90028. It is adjacent to Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and just a short stroll from Hollywood & Highland Center, where the Kodak Theatre, Lucky Strike Lanes, and dozens of shops and restaurants can be found."
Los Angeles,"Hollywood Sign - Los Angeles, California - Symbol of Hollywood and the Film Industry","The Hollywood Sign on the slopes of Mount Lee in Los Angeles is one of the most recognizable and photographed landmarks in the world. Its nine white letters have come to symbolize all that glitters, metaphorically representing ambition, glamour and dreams of success: H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D.In 1923, the first sign was erected here, but it was not much like the one so well known today. It was a huge, illuminated advertisement for an upscale real estate development called ""Hollywoodland.'' The original sign cost $21,000 and included thirteen 50-foot high letters that were painted white. Mule teams and tractors were used to haul the sign's 3' x 9' panels up Mount Lee. They were attached to frames made of pipe, wire, and telephone poles. Some 4,000 20-watt light bulbs were installed on the letters at intervals of eight inches. When the sign was finally lit, the result was dazzling, attracting attention and tourists from far beyond Southern California.The developers intended to take the sign down after a year. But by then, it had become so popular as a glamorous symbol for Hollywood that city officials persuaded the owner, Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler, to let it remain. Without proper maintenance, however, the sign fell into disrepair during the Great Depression. In 1932, a struggling 24-year-old actress named Peg Entwhistle committed suicide by leaping from the top of the letter H. By the mid-1940s, neighborhood residents wanted the sign removed.But the City of Los Angeles had other plans for the Hollywoodland billboard and its surrounding 450 acres. They purchased the land for expansion of Griffith Park. In 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce contracted to repair and rebuild the sign, removing the letters ""L-A-N-D'' so that it spelled ""Hollywood.'' It was also stripped of its light bulbs as a cost-cutting measure.Keeping the Hollywood Sign maintained over the next half century turned out to be a challenge. Termites infested the wood and toppled the ""O.'' Arsonists set the bottom of one ""L'' on fire. Vandals altered the sign's letters to read ""Hollyweed'' in support of marijuana legalization and then ""Holywood'' when Pope John Paul II visited the city. At one point, Hugh Hefner stepped in to raise funds for a $250,000 makeover of the sign, supported by movie celebrities ranging from Alice Cooper to Andy Williams and Gene Autry, among others.The current sign, dating from 1978 and classified as an Historic Monument, is anchored by 194 tons of concrete. It sports a steel frame and corrugated baked enamel letters. The letters are four stories high, 450-feet long and weigh 480,000 pounds. It was completed in time to celebrate Hollywood's 75th Anniversary and was specially illuminated for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.Today, walking into the restricted area around the sign is a trespassing violation. To ensure that the sign and its hillside site are preserved for the enjoyment of future generations, the Hollywood Sign Trust was established in 1978. As part of its mission, the Trust has installed a high-tech security system in concert with city officials, police and fire authorities, park rangers, and the Department of Homeland Security. The security system includes a tall perimeter fence with razor wire, 24-hour electronic surveillance, monitoring microphones and bullhorns, web cameras, motion sensors and patrols by city police and park ranger helicopters.For visitors, the closest viewing points are in Hollywood Hills, at the end of Beachwood Canyon Drive or just above the Hollywood Reservoir, also known as Lake Hollywood. The latter can be a bit tricky to find. Access is via the Barham Boulevard Exit on the 101 freeway. Parking can be found on adjacent roads, but be sure not to block the driveways of local residents.The Hollywood Sign is so prominent that it can also be seen clearly from many locations south of Mount Lee. Some of the best spots for taking photographs are the intersections at Hollywood & Highland, Hollywood & Gower, and Gower & Franklin Avenue. The view of the sign from Griffith Park Observatory is also excellent. Anyone interested in more information about the sign or contributing to its preservation can contact the Hollywood Sign Trust at P.O. Box 48361, Los Angeles, California 90048-9998."
Los Angeles,Hotel Bel-Air - Los Angeles - A Heavenly Hideaway,"High above the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles just west of the city is one of the world's finest hotels. Part of the 1922 development plan of Alphonso E. Bell, who gave birth to the Bel-Air Estates, the Bel-Air Hotel has been a favorite getaway place for more than half a century.The Hotel Bel-Air originally served as the planning and sales office for the Bel-Air Estates. It officially opened in 1946 after several years of planning and construction. Geographically, the Hotel Bel-Air is located approximately one mile to the west of Beverly Hills, about a half-mile off of the famed Sunset Boulevard, and two miles from the 405 freeway high above the canyons of Los Angeles.Surrounded by close to 12 acres of trees and plants, the hotel features beautiful fountains and wrought-iron terraces that compliment its mission-style architecture, which was designed by renowned architect Burton Schut, who immediately began to convert the existing buildings and design and construct additional buildings to make up the earliest version of the Hotel Bel-Air. It was through the work of Burton Schut that many of the hotel's characteristic gardens and landscaping was added. Schut is also responsible for adding the popular Swan Lake to the hotel's front lawn, which greets guests as they enter the grounds of the Hotel Bel-Air.Part of what makes the hotel so popular with its guests is the fact that of its ninety-one rooms, not two are alike. Each of these unique guest rooms has its very own floor plan and view, as well as its own private entrance and access to the hotel's swimming pool - which was curiously one of Marilyn Monroe's favorite spot to spend time. Many of the hotel's rooms also feature private tiled patios, fountains, as well as personal fireplaces.Among the hotels many popular services and facilities are The Restaurant, which offers a slightly informal dining experience that features French-Californian and Mediterranean dining. Along with The Restaurant, the Hotel Bel-Air also features outdoor dining in the form of the Terrace, which was added in 2002. Additionally, The Bar has become a sight for visitors and Bel-Air residents to gather for a drink and a little entertainment. An exclusive dining area known simply as Table One rounds off the hotels offerings. Table One is essentially a large table located inside the hotel's kitchen where up to eight guests can watch hotel chefs prepare their meals.For more than fifty years, the Hotel Bel-Air has been a popular site for some of Hollywood's brightest stars past and present. Celebrities like Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, and Elizabeth Taylor have all been guests of the hotel. Today, the Hotel Bel-Air is a favorite of stars like Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman, and Hillary Swank. In 2006, $20 million was spent updating the interior of the hotel's guestrooms, an act that resulted in the hotel being named the #1 hotel in the United States by several respected publications."

Los Angeles,Martin Jauregui,"So Cal Attraction ArticleJ. Paul Getty Center - Los Angeles - A Comprehensive Center for the ArtsOverlooking the 405 Freeway and high atop Los Angeles' Santa Monica Mountains is one of the country's most celebrated centers for the study, promotion, presentation, and preservation of art. The J. Paul Getty Center, also known as The Getty, opened its doors for the first time in 1997 with the idea of making some of the world's greatest works of art available for all to see, understand, and enjoy, both academically and aesthetically.Almost 2 million visitors a year make their way through the doors at 1200 Getty Center Drive to view everything from paintings to photographs. The project that took more than a decade to plan and finalize pays tribute to both the surrounding urban areas and ancient Greco-Roman architecture in its design. Visitors enter the center through a glass hallway and into a courtyard. The space that makes up the Getty Center is divided into five individual buildings, and also contains a cafy and a space dedicated to temporary exhibits. Fountains and finely manicured shrubbery dot the center's landscape, while 34 acres of preserved and protected parkland surround the complex. 	The actual center, which sits on 24 acres or more than 1 million square feet of land, was designed and conceptualized by architect Richard Meier, who has been responsible for designing other projects around the world, including the Church of the Year 2000 in Rome, the Jesolo Lido Village in Italy, and the Atheneum in New Harmony, Indiana.Unlike its predecessor the Getty Villa in Malibu, California, which itself recently re-opened after an extensive renovation process, the J. Paul Getty Center in Los Angeles has taken a decidedly more comprehensive approach to the arts. While the Getty Villa serves mainly as a space for the exhibition of ancient Greek and Roman art and antiquities, the new Getty Center in Los Angeles does more than just exhibit works of art. The center itself actually consists of four distinct programs, including the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Foundation, and the actual Getty Museum.The Getty Research Center is a center for education as well as professional collaboration in the area of the visual arts. The Getty Conservation Institute focuses its efforts on conserving everything from individual pieces of art to entire collections and sites. The Getty Foundation makes use of several grants and programs to provide support for individuals and organizations that themselves are dedicated to education and preservation in the area of the visual arts.The most popular program associated with the center by far is the Getty Museum. World renowned for its permanent and temporary exhibits, the museum houses some of the world's best-known and most expensive works of art, including Vincent van Gogh's famed 1889 painting Irises, drawings and sketches from Auguste Rodin, and a recently acquired painting by Peter Paul Rubens that was previously only known through copies. More than 400 other European paintings dating as far back as the 1300s make up the museum's collection, which also includes close to 700 drawings and sketches, manuscripts from as far back as the ninth century, and a vast collection of photographs from dozens of American and European photographers."
Los Angeles,"Kodak Theatre - Los Angeles, California - Home to Hollywood's Academy Awards","The 3,332-seat Kodak Theatre is located in the heart of historic Hollywood, where it serves as the hub of the retail, dining and entertainment complex known as Hollywood & Highland Center.

Los Angeles,"LA Fashion District - Los Angeles, California - Center for Wholesale Apparel, Textiles, Flowers and More","The LA Fashion District sprawls across 90 blocks of downtown Los Angeles, serving as the hub of the West Coast's apparel industry. The area is bordered by 7th Street to the north, the Santa Monica Freeway to the south, San Pedro Street to the east, and Spring and Main Streets to the west. This is where the business of fashion happens, as retailers, wholesale buyers, clothing designers, stylists, students, shoppers and local residents all converge, drawn by the convenience of ""everything fashion'' in one location.The LA Fashion District was designated as the city's first business improvement district (BID) in 1996. It is funded by more than 700 property owners who contribute over $3 million annually to sponsor maintenance, security and marketing programs aimed at making this community a clean, safe and friendly place to live, work, shop, and do business.The main order of business in the LA Fashion District is wholesaling, with emphasis on designer goods. In fact, some 80 percent of the 2,000+ independent businesses here sell wholesale garments. The District hosts five major market weeks a year within the showroom buildings of ""The Intersection.'' Other business events, such as frequent gift/home markets and textile tradeshows, are conducted in the California Market Center. Please note that the market weeks and shows are intended for trade representatives only and are not open to the general public.In addition to finished apparel, the LA Fashion District is home to the country's largest selection of fabrics and notions in the United States.

With prices ranging from 99 cents to thousands of dollars per yard, nearly every type of fabric can be found in the District, from novelty patterns to exotic silks and embroidered upholstery. Most of the textile and notion stores are congregated in a four block area, from 8th Street to Olympic Boulevard and between Maple Avenue and San Julian Street.Even though the majority of stores in the LA Fashion District are wholesalers, there are plenty of shops serving retail shoppers, too. Bargain hunters will find some 1,000 places that sell apparel and accessories to the general public at discounts of 30 to 70 percent off retail prices. Most of these stores are independent, not brand name or chain stores.Another feature of the LA Fashion District that helps it draw more than one and a half million visitors annually is the largest wholesale and retail floral selection in the United States, located along 8th Street.

Los Angeles,Little Tokyo in Los Angeles - Los Angeles - Experience Japanese Culture,"Few cities in the world offer people the opportunity to experience culture like Los Angeles does, and few places in Los Angeles offer people the opportunity to truly soak in all aspects of a culture the way Los Angeles' Little Tokyo does. Little Tokyo is located in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. Its boundaries include Los Angeles Street and Alameda Street on the east and west, while 3rd Street and 1st Street make up the southern and northern borders respectively. Los Angeles' Little Tokyo is only one of three officially recognized Japanese ""towns"" in the United States, with the other two being located in San Jose and San Francisco in northern California.Despite being the smallest of the three, Los Angeles' Little Tokyo still represents the cultural center of the city for Japanese and Japanese American residents and visitors, as well as for visitors in general. Declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1995, Little Tokyo in Los Angeles is the home for everything Japanese, from food and groceries, to clothing and gifts.Very few Japanese and Japanese Americans actually live in the Little Tokyo district, which has become more a place to shop, eat, and work, than a place to live. Still, the area is highlighted by a variety of shops, eateries, cultural centers, and museums, and remains popular with the city's Japanese community. The Japanese American National Museum, the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center, the Geffen Contemporary Museum, and the East West Players theater are all located within the boundaries of Little Tokyo. Every August, Little Tokyo also serves as the location for the Nisei Week festival and parade.Aside from its cultural offerings, Little Tokyo is also renowned for its traditional eateries and restaurants, many of which are famous for a specific type of Japanese cuisine. Traditional Japanese bowls or stews known as donburi, Japanese soba and udon noodles, as well as curry and sushi can all be found in several Little Tokyo Restaurants. One of the more popular restaurants in Little Tokyo is the Shabu Shabu House, which is believed to be the city's first such restaurant. This traditional family style way of eating has become popular with both Japanese and non-Japanese residents of the city, who will often wait up to two hours for the opportunity to dip and cook their vegetables and thin slices of beef in a bowl of boiling water.Several public sculptures can be found dotting the Little Tokyo district, including one that pays tribute to the Challenger Space Shuttle astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka, a Japanese American. Little Tokyo also features two of the oldest food-based shops in all of Los Angeles. A shop that goes by the name of Fugetsu-do, founded in 1903, is possibly the oldest restaurant still operating in Los Angeles - and claims to be the birthplace of the fortune cookie. Mikawaya, founded in 1910, is a Japanese sweet shop where mochi ice cream was first introduced to the United States."
Los Angeles,"Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens - Los Angeles, California - zoo and garden run by the city of Los Angeles","In 1966, the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens opened in the heart of the city to help bring the wild to those living in this area. Since that time, the facility has grown to include hundreds of animals, as well as unique plant life from around the world. Today, it is run by its own department within the City Council, called the greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, which deals with organizing the workforce at the zoo, fundraising, providing zoo publications, and more.While the animals are a huge attraction to the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens, the gardens themselves showcase an impressive collection of trees, flowers, cacti, and other plants from around the world. The landscaping of the zoo itself was meant to help provide food for the animals and to show visitors the natural habitats for these animals. In 2003, the zoo was accredited with the American Association of Museums for the vast plants they included as their live museum. These are over 7000 plants in the zoo, representing over 800 different species. It takes 16 full-time gardeners and a number of part-time employees and volunteers to care for the plants found in the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens. The facility also serves as one of the country's Plant Rescue Centers, providing temporary care for rare plants that were rescued after people attempted to smuggle them into the country.The Children's Zoo area is home to a number of species that can be petted and fed by younger visitors in some cases and which provide other interactive opportunities. Such animals in this exhibit include dairy goats, sheep, ocelots, pelicans, and porcupines.The animals featured at the zoo's entrance are the harbor seal and the American alligator. Other animals that are part of the main zoo include meerkats, flamingos, sea lions, koalas, African wild dogs, zebra, gorillas, giraffes, lions, elephants, ostriches, eagles, tigers, hippos, spider monkeys, aldabra giant tortoises, tapirs, vultures, snow leopards, black bears, and rhinos. They also have an aviary, which is home to animals such as the plush-crested jay, the sacred ibis, the West African crowned crane, and the Inca tern.There are a number of places to eat while visiting Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens. The Safari Cafy is a gourmet coffee shop with snakes and both indoor and outdoor seating. La Casita has Mexican food, while the Gorilla Grill, Silverback Cafy, Mahale Cafy, and Zoo Grill feature casual dining. There are also two shopping centers located in the zoo so that visitors can go home with zoo memorabilia, educational toys, or even African crafts.Admission prices to the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens range from $6 to $12, depending on the age of the visitor and the size of the group. Parking at the zoo is free. They also have joint tickets with the city's Aquarium of the Pacific so guests can visit both sites for a single, lower price. The zoo is open daily until 5:00 PM, with ticket stands closing at 4:00 PM."
Los Angeles,Los Angeles County Museum of Art - Los Angeles - History On Display,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, known to many as the LACMA, is the western United States' largest art museum. What began humbly in 1910 as an addition to the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art in Exposition Park, grew in just a few decades to become the home of one of the most comprehensive art collections in the United States and the world.The beginning of the museum's life was nothing like its current existence however. In 1910 when the museum opened, there was no collection of art to display. In fact, for a time the art in the museum actually had to be borrowed from external and private sources until funds could be secured which would allow the museum to begin to purchase its own works. With a great deal of public and private support, including extensive contributions on the part of William Randolph Hearst who contributed money and personal pieces of art, the museum quickly grew, especially during the period of time between the 1920s and the 1950s.By the 1960s, the collection had outgrown its original home, and museum officials and Trustees began looking to establish a museum separate from the Natural History Museum. A donation of land by Allan Hancock gave the Trustees the land they were seeking and in 1965, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art officially opened as its own separate museum of art. Located at 5905 Wilshire Boulevard on the famed Miracle Mile, the LACMA today plays host to close to a million visitors a year who come to view the museum's collection of more than 100,000 objects and pieces of art that cover and represent nearly the entire history of art, from ancient works of art to modern masterpieces.The museum itself consists of seven buildings, and is currently undergoing a major renovation which when complete, will successfully unite the buildings that make up the museum's ""campus"". In addition, the project known as the Transformation will also result in the renovation of several buildings, and the expansion of several galleries. Currently, the renovation of the LACMA has resulted in the construction of an open-air visitors pavilion as well as 60,000 square foot exhibition space that currently serves as the home of art by the likes of artists like Cindy Sherman, Chris Burden, and Jasper Johns.Over its forty-six year history, the Los Angeles Museum of County Museum of Art has given the visiting public a chance to view works of art from every country, and from just about every period of human history. The LACMA provides tours, discussions, and educational programs intended to promote artistic understanding and appreciation. The museum currently holds an impressive collection of Asian works of art, as well as Latin American artwork from popular artists like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. The museum's collection of Islamic art is considered by many to be one of the world's most impressive and significant."

Los Angeles,"Monastery of the Angels - Los Angeles, California - Domicile for Dominican Contemplative Life","Not long before his foundation of the Order of Friars Preachers, Saint Dominic founded the Dominican nuns in 1207, gathering converts from the Albigensian heresy in the Monastery of Blessed Mary of Prouille near Fanjeaux, France. He set them upon a preaching mission, instructing them to live a contemplative life and study the Word of God. Today, Dominican nuns follow that life in countries around the world.In Los Angeles, the Monastery of the Angels was created in 1924 by Mother Mary of the Eucharist from the Dominican Monastery in Newark, New Jersey, the first such enclave in the United States. She arrived at the invitation of the Archbishop Cantwell of Los Angeles. Mother Mary was also accompanied by four other nuns from Newark: Sister Mary of Jesus, Sister Mary Raphael, Sister Mary Gabriel and Sister Mary of the Immaculate Conception.The sisters' initial residence was on 28th Street in downtown Los Angeles. They were able to live a monastic life there until it became possible to purchase land on which to build a permanent home in the 1930s. A hilly property became available in the Hollywood area, and the Monastery of the Angels moved from 28th Street to its present location on Carmen Avenue, one block north of Franklin on North Gower, within sight of the famous Hollywood sign in Hollywood Hills.The Giroux Family Mansion occupied the area at the bottom of the hill, and that is where the nuns set up their domicile. In place of the property's grand fountain, they erected a Statue of Our Lady. Behind the mansion at the top of the rise, so-called ""Monastery Hill,'' they put up a Statue of the Sacred Heart. The space in front of the mansion, with its landscaped gardens and lawns, was marked for development of the monastery proper.Dominican nuns living a inside a Hollywood mansion might seen a bit of a dichotomy, but the sisters adapted as best they could, ""bearing witness to Christ where that witness was needed most,'' until after World War Two. The first section of the permanent monastery was finished just in time to celebrate Christmas Midnight Mass in 1948.Today, the Monastery of the Angels shows little sign of its non-contemplative past. Its Chapel of Perpetual Adoration now serves as the center of the monastic complex, where visitors as well as residents may say their prayers and spend their holy hours. The sisters take turns praying, night and day, so that one or another continually perpetuates the act of adoration.Meals here are eaten silently in a large room called the Refectory. Sleep takes place intermittently in monastic cells. A life of ""hiddenness'' goes on quietly behind the monastery walls, devoted to spiritual reading, meditation, never-ending prayer, penance, contemplation, and unceasing adoration.The Gift Shop of the Monastery of the Angels is open daily except Sundays from 8:30am until 5pm. The specialty items sold here are made by the nuns and include creative cards, crocheted and knitted items, original paintings, pumpkin bread and hand-made candies. Also on sale are candles, books and religious objects. The shop accepts enrollments in the Venite Adoremus Association and issues Prayer Association cards, too.The Monastery of the Angels is located within walking distance of Hollywood Boulevard at 1977 Carmen Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90068-4098. Visitors are extended an open invitation to come pray with the residents. Access from Burbank Airport is more convenient than from LAX. The gate is open daily from 5am to 5pm."
Los Angeles,Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County - Los Angeles - Inspiring Wonder and Discovery,"The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, founded in 1913, is home to one of the country's most extensive collections of natural specimens and artifacts. The collection, which contains almost 35 million pieces, covers about 4.5 billion years of natural Earth history and is the largest such collection in the western United States. In addition to its own collection, the Natural History Museum also receives and displays items and artifacts that have been discovered at another local museum, the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits.The museum contains artifacts from a variety of fields, including specimens from areas like entomology herpetology, botany, mineralogy, ornithology, and vertebrate paleontology. Despite the extent of the collection, visitors to the Natural History Museum still manage to flock to four displays in particular, including those dedicated to animal habitats, pre-Columbian cultures, insects, and dinosaurs. Children who visit the museum are particularly fond of exhibits like the Pavilion of Wings - a beautiful butterfly exhibit, the Spider Pavilion - dedicated to various types of arachnids, and the Bug Fair, where children and visitors alike can get hands-on with a variety of ""creepy crawlers"".Externally, the museum is well known for two distinct features: its main building and a sculpture/statue that adorns the street side of the museum. The museum's main building consists of fitted marble walls and a unique domed and colonnaded rotunda reminiscent of early 19th century architecture. More recently, the museum added an amazing, life-sized sculpture of a Tyrranosaurus Rex battling with a Triceratops. The statue is clearly visible to anyone driving or walking by the side of the museum that faces Exposition Boulevard and has become a popular place for souvenir photographs.Internally, the museum consists of three floors of permanent displays and exhibits. Visitors who enter are quickly greeted by two complete dinosaur skeletons, one of a T-rex and one of a Triceratops, both of which are located in the famed Grand Foyer which has itself also been filmed in several movies. Besides being a museum, the Natural History Museum is also one of the country's best centers for research into natural history. Projects that make up the museum's Research and Collections Department are currently conducting research into invertebrates, vertebrates, minerals, local California history, and Native American and Pre-Columbian anthropology.Originally known as the Museum of History, Science, and Art, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County became its own individual museum dedicated to Earth's natural history when its artistic wing broke off to become the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, or the LACMA. It was in fact the city of Los Angeles' first cultural center to be open exclusively to the public. The beauty and importance of the museum's collection and its architecture were recognized by the National Register of Historic Places, making sure that the museum, its work, and its collections will be preserved and protected for generations to come."

Over the next 18 months, at a cost of over $65,000, he completely refurbished the vehicles. The Duesenberg and the DuPont today remain as centerpieces of the Nethercutt Collection.Before Nethercutt passed away in 2004, he summed up his collection, saying, ""The recognition and preservation of beauty has been a major focus of my life. It would suit me well if what people remembered about me was, `Where he went, he left beauty behind.'''All of the components of the Nethercutt Museum and Collection are open to the public free of charge.

The initial run in 1991 went from Chicago to New York via New River Gorge.The business was later sold and resold until Henry Hillman Jr., founder of Avia, acquired it with a view to showcasing National Parks by train. Several itineraries were developed, one of the most popular being the National Parks of the West. Passengers were taken as close as possible to Sequoia & King's Canyon, Yosemite, Great Basin, Rocky Mountain, and others, with motor coaches used to transport them into the parks proper.Accommodations were nothing short of first class, from Pullman sleeper cars and passenger cars with mahogany and brass fittings to two separate dining cars serving meals on tables set with china, silver, crystal, and linen.

Los Angeles,Casa de Sousa,"This vegetarian restaurant on Olvera Street receives mixed reviews from patrons.

The menu includes salads, tamales, and veggie burgers and sandwiches. They also feature Mexican hot chocolate and a variety of coffee drinks, many made with soy milk. Many of the menu items feature chocolate including the drinks and dessert tamales. There is no kitchen on the premises and since the food is delivered, some menu choices are not always available.

The store features a small gallery where you can browse Mexican and Central American folk art pieces.

Los Angeles,Capitol Records Building,"This iconic Los Angeles building is recognizable even to those who have never stepped foot in California. The tower is 13-stories in eight and has withstood numerous Southern California earthquakes. Originally, the height of the building was dictated by the earthquake restrictions which were later removed in the 1960's when other ways of protecting buildings were developed. When EMI bought Capital Records in the mid-1950's, they requested this building to be built at the famed intersection of Hollywood and Vine. Its location in the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District is listed on the Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles. While the building's design was not intended to look like a record, many believe this is exactly what it resembles. There is a blinking light on top of the building that spells Hollywood in Morse Code in a marketing effort thought up by then-president of Capitol Records, Alan Livingston. The first record ever recorded in the building was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color, released in 1956.

Blacker, the Blacker House is located in Pasadena, California and listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places. The house was built in 1907 by Robert and his wife Nellie Canfield Blacker.The house and all of its features were custom-designed. Both of the Blackers had died by the mid-1940's and the property fell into probate. While no heirs were listed, Nellie did specify that the house, land, and all of its furnishings be sold as a whole. Unfortunately, this did not occur and the land was parceled off after its sale which destroyed the gardens on the property. Today the house sits on a one acre piece of land and the garage and caretaker's cottage are considered separate. The furniture was sold as well at a yard sale. Many of the pieces were relocated to museums across the country, and a good potion of them were returned to the Blacker House by a family that had lived down the street at the time of sale and purchased a large portion of the furnishings. During the 1980's, the owner of the Blacker House brought in an antiques dealer to dismantle much of the home, an event that later became known as the Rape of the Blacker House. The house has since been restored and the completion of the project was celebrated with a celebrity-attended benefit dinner."

Originally designed by Victor Gruen and Associates for upscale shopping, it counted William H. Block and L. S. Ayres as its initial anchor tenants. The latter was later replaced by a branch of Macy's department store.After the property was acquired by Kite Realty in 1999, plans were set in place for substantial renovation, including 75,000 square feet of new construction. Today, Glendale Town Center covers 685,000 square feet anchored by Macy's on the north end and Lowe's on the south. Taking the middle position and opened in 2008, Target occupies the upper level, while a branch of Staples can be found below. Other shops and retail outlets include AT&T, Catherine's, Famous Footwear, Lenscrafters, Snapdragon Salon & Spa, and Walgreen's.On October 23, 2000, the Glendale Branch Library opened its doors to the public here, making Glendale Town Center the country's first major shopping mall with a full-service library. As part of the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library District, this branch is an essential community information service, providing materials and programs that support citizens' lifelong learning, recreational and economic interests. Patrons wishing to access the library may use either entrance on the lower level of the south end of the Mall facing North Keystone Avenue.With the support of sponsors, a section of the lower level near the library entrance has been turned into an area called ""Legends Live On.'' The exhibit features as its primary attraction three life-size penguin statues - Wynkin, Blynkin and Nod. The ""adventurous trio'' was originally created as a gift for the first opening of Glendale Mall more than 50 years ago. They have since become a symbol of the local community.For dining, visitors to Glendale Town Center have five choices: Monical's Pizza, Squeeze Fresh Smoothies, Panera Bread, O'Charley's and Taco Bell. And for entertainment, the Glendale Kerasotes ShowPlace 12 offers first-run Hollywood films on 12 large screens along with free refills on any size fountain drink or popcorn.Sponsored locally by Clarian Health and Macy's, a national nonprofit educational organization for mature adults called OASIS has a branch at Glendale Town Center, too. It offers programs in the arts, humanities, wellness, technology and volunteer service, creating opportunities for older adults to continue their personal growth and provide meaningful service to the community. Membership is free and open to anyone 55 or older.A few years ago, the Broad Ripple and Castleton locations of Indiana University Medical Group (IUMG) were merged and relocated to their new home the Glendale Town Center, in front of Macy's Department store. Also headquartered here is the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership (INHP), a not-for-profit organization that offers services and programs - including financial coaching and classroom instruction - to help Indianapolis residents through the home-buying process.The address of the Glendale Town Center, also known as Glendale Shopping Center or Glendale Center Mall, is 6101 N Keystone Ave, Indianapolis, Indiana 46220. Shoppers and visitors can easily access the retail outlets and spacious parking areas from Keystone Avenue, 62nd Street or Rural Street. Center hours vary by tenant."

Indianapolis,"Indianapolis Motor Speedway - Indianapolis, Indiana - Leader in Auto Racing in Heart of the Midwest Since 1909","The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has been registered as a National Historic Landmark since 1987. The Speedway is located at 4790 W. 16th St. in Indianapolis, Indiana. The raceway was first built in 1909 and is most known as the permanent home of the Indy500 race which takes place annually on Memorial Day weekend. The first 500 mile race took place in May of 1911. Today the event attracts more than 250,000 spectators and is broadcast around the world.The historic 2.5 mile oval race track is also called the Brickyard. The track was originally built of crushed rock and tar but switched to brick in order to provide a smoother surface the same year of construction (1909). Resurfacing with asphalt did not occur until 1976. Today a line of the original brick surfacing remains in place marking the start/finish line of the track. The track was originally built to test new automobile designs and race them in order for the public to see them competing and thus promote auto industry sales.A new 2.605 mile Formula One track was inaugurated at the Speedway in 2008.The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has hosted Grand Prix Formula One events and NASCAR racing as well as the Indianapolis 500 race and other events. It is undeniably the most renowned automobile racing venue in the world. The Speedway also operates a neighboring hotel and 18-hole golf course.Just inside the main entrance to the facility the Hall of Fame Museum is found. The museum displays more than 75 race cars, as well as a wall of winners' photos of the Indy 500 and other memorabilia of the Indy 500 and other racing history from around the globe. One of the major attractions at the museum is being able to sit in a race car chassis and pose for a souvenir photo.Ninety minute tours of the track and its different areas are available 4 times a day between March and Thanksgiving, spaces on the tours are limited and special tours can be arranged for groups.The Hulman family, which owns the track today, bought the raceway in 1945. Tony Hulman named Wilbur Shaw General Manager and President. In the early 50's it was Shaw who would coin the now world famous racing phrase of ""Gentlemen, Start Your Engines"" here at the Speedway.The Speedway has always been at the forefront of pioneering new racing technologies. One example is the SAFER barrier made of steel and foam installed originally at the track's corners in 2002 and later upgraded. The barriers were designed and improved by the Indy Racing League in conjunction with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Midwest Roadside Safety Facility. These barriers were built to lessen crash impact for a vehicle and thus improve safety for its driver.The Nomex fiber firesuit is another one of the innovations in the sport first designed and used at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway."
Indianapolis,"Irvington Historic District in Indianapolis, Indiana","Irvington, Indiana was originally founded as a suburban town in 1870.  The town formed along winding roads made of dirt and brick that spoke of the Romanesque design era. Originally, the town was a quiet haven for artists, politicians, academics, military generals and local industry lived. However, in 1902, Irvington was annexed and though it is a part of the city, the area still remains very much like a private neighborhood.Located on the Western edge of Indianapolis, Irvington is five miles away from downtown Indianapolis on the edge of Warren Township. The neighborhood is located on the historic road US 40, and through the 1900's, a trolley ran from Irvington into Indianapolis. Today, the town is the largest historically preserved location in Indianapolis and has approximately 2,800 buildings and 1,600 parcels of land.Irvington was the home of the only artist movement in Central Indiana and was named for a specific place, the Irvington Group. During the 1900's the Irvington Group lived, worked and exhibited art in Irvington and today many of the houses and studios remain standing. The arts were and are still taught at the Irvington Lodge, Bona Thomas Memorial Library and the Studio School and Gallery.The town is both historically and architecturally important to Indiana, because it contains fine examples of every type of American architecture style from 1870 through 1950. There are examples of Italianate, Victorian Gothic, Queen Anne, French Second Empire, and Colonial and Tudor Revival. US 40, or as it is more commonly known, Washington Street, is home to several buildings and businesses of historical importance such as the old bank and the Irving Theater.The Benton House is a local landmark in Irvington, the home was built by Allen R. Benton in 1873. The Irvington Historic Landmarks Foundation was formed in 1966, and purchased the property and restored the home. In 1973, the home was placed on the National of Historic Places and is listed as a museum; the Benton House is the only landmark in Indiana open to the public.The Stephenson Mansion is a home in Indianapolis that has the most interesting history. The home was built for William H. H. Graham in 1895; in 1923, the home was purchased by D.C. Stephenson who remodeled the home to resemble a Civil War era plantation house. D.C. Stephenson was a well known affiliate of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. He has a long and checkered past and this in turn has brought more attention to the mansion. Today, the mansion remains shrouded in controversy and intrigue, with many visitors claiming the location to be haunted.Irvington continues to remain a family friendly community. Every year there are festivals held during the spring, summer and autumn that invite guests to get to know about town of Irvington and its history. The town welcomes people with a warmth and friendliness that are well known to visitors to the Midwest."
Indianapolis,"Lafayette Square Mall - Indianapolis, Indiana - Indiana's First & Oldest Indoor Mall","Located seven miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis, Lafayette Square Mall is Indiana's oldest indoor shopping center. It was developed by Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. in 1968. At that time, it featured four anchor tenants: Sears, Penney's, G. C. Murphy, and Blocks.In the early 1970s, Lazarus and L. S. Ayres were added to the mall, which enjoyed its heyday for the better part of three decades. It attracted Wards department store when Blocks moved out in 1986, and Waccamaw replaced G. C. Murphy in 1993. A food court was then added in 1997, featuring McDonalds, Luca Pizza, Cinnabon, Wok-Right-In, Nick's Gyros, and Charley's Steakery.Lafayette Square's decline began when Wards closed in 1997. Statistically high crime rates and low sales plagued the mall in the opening years of the 21st century. Despite renovations, other stores followed suit and shuttered, until not one of the original anchors remained.Today, Lafayette Square Mall is owned by Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation and managed by Jones Lang LaSalle. Its enclosed shopping area covers 1.2 million square feet of retail space, situated on 113 acres adjacent to Interstate 65. Two department stores, Burlington Coat Factory and Shoppers World, now serve as the primary tenants.A third anchor is the 75,000-square-foot indoor amusement park and family entertainment center known as Xscape. Its facilities include a buffet style restaurant, several themed dining rooms, and a sports bar for adults. Among other amenities, Xscape offers laser tag, go-karting, bumper cars, mini-bowling, mini-golf and a game arcade, too.More than a dozen categories of goods are sold at 90 smaller retailers positioned between the anchor stores. These include cards / books / records / stationery, children's fashions / shoes / toys, family entertainment items, specialty retail / gifts / luggage, and home accessories. Also available are men's fashion, cellular services, men's and women's shoes, specialty food, sporting goods / apparel and women's fashion, as well as personal and professional services.National retailers represented at Lafayette Square Mall include RadioShack, Payless ShoeSource, Victoria's Secret, Kay Jewelers, and Bath & Body Works. There are also branches of The Children's Place, GameStop, Champs, Foot Locker, and The Finish Line, among others. And wireless phone service providers are also here in force, including Sprint/Nextel, T-Mobile, Crossroads Wireless/AT&T, and the Phone Zone.In 2007, Wal-Mart opened a new supercenter in the Lafayette Square area as part of the company's Jobs and Opportunity Zone (JOZ) program. It has been joined by another new retailer nearby, Garden Ridge. With a $550 million redevelopment project taking place along Interstate 465 and urban renewal getting underway on West 38th Street, the mall is poised for a renaissance of sorts. Estimates put the number of cars passing by the mall each day at 154,000.One new program intended to spur customer loyalty at Lafayette Square Mall is The Shopping Club. By simply entering an email address on the mall's web site, shoppers can receive money-saving coupons and receive advance notification of special deals and events.Lafayette Square Mall is open Monday through Saturday from 10am to 9pm, and on Sundays from noon to 6pm.

Indianapolis,"Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis, Indiana - home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts","Boasted as ""America's newest special events venue,'' Lucas Oil Stadium is home to the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, a professional football team. Located in Indiana's capital city, Lucas Oil Stadium is also scheduled host to events such as NCAA men and women's basketball and the DCI World Championship in future years.Opened on August 16, 2008 after three years of construction, Lucas Oil Stadium replaced the RCA dome as the home playing field for the Colts. The opening game was between the Colts and the Buffalo Bills on August 24, but the first game played in the stadium was actually a series of high school football games as part of the PeyBeck Classic. The two games played were Noblesville High School versus Fishers High School, and New Palestine High School versus Whiteland Community High School.The stadium itself cost $720 million to build, and operating costs are expected to be $10 million more per year than the RCA Dome. The name of the venue is part of a $121 million deal with Lucas Oil, a California-based company that specializes in automotive products, particularly oil. The contract is expected to last over the course of 20 years. Lucas Oil Stadium is owned by the Indiana Stadium and Convention Building Authority.One of the stadium's most attractive features is its retractable roof, consisting of two panels weighing roughly 2.7 million pounds apiece. Opening or closing the roof takes about nine minutes.The venue offers 63,000 seats for football fans, and up to 70,000 for other events such as basketball games and concerts. All entrances to the venue are easily accessible for those with disabilities, and five guest service kiosks can be found about the stadium for fans in need of any extra assistance. Parking is available for roughly 9,000 vehicles around the venue, with 40,000 spaces available within an area of ten-blocks.Within the walls of Lucas Oil Stadium are 160 concession stands, 51 of these being permanent stands. Fans also have the option to visit the Colts Pro Shop, a multi-leveled center for anything even the most die-hard Colts fan might need. Of course, plenty of novelty stands are also stationed about the venue, allowing fans to get their Colts memorabilia while on the go.The playing surface is FieldTurf, and resting on the northwest and southeast corners of the field are Daktronics Hi-Definition scoreboards, each with dimensions of 97' x 53'. Eight field suites are part of the 137 luxury suites available at Lucas Oil Stadium. Twelve super suites are also available for lease. Another option is the Quarterback Suite, which has room for 200 people, and can be used for private events.Tours are offered, but the suggested group size should be larger than 25 people. Tours generally last about one hour and allow visitors to see the playing field, locker rooms, and other parts of the stadium, such as the press box, that are usually closed off to the public."

Indianapolis,"The Fort Golf Resort, Indianapolis, Indiana - An 18-Hole Championship Golf Course, Redesigned by Pete Dye","The Fort Golf Resort is an 18-hole championship golf course found on 238 secluded acres within Ft. Harrison State Park, but is located just minutes from Indianapolis. The course has received national renown since being redesigned in 1995 by Pete Dye and re-opening in 1997.The course features a varied terrain with significant elevation changes, rolling hills and fairways lined with trees, natural wetlands and large, undulating greens. Golfers can encounter deep ravines at one turn, or wide fairways lined with mature forests at others. The green complexes are also varied, with some guarded by grassy swales and deep bunkers, or open fronts that allow for bump-and-run play. The course also features more than 50 sand bunkers, as well as a creek that crosses the fairways on several holes.The par-72 design plays to 7,148 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74.4 and a slope rating of 139. Because of the elevation changes, golfers may find themselves thinking twice about club selection when hitting from elevated tees or approaching elevated greens. In addition, it's not uncommon to encounter a hole that looks open but plays narrower than it appears from the tee.  The greens tend to be medium-sized and undulating, with some double-tiered, and well-bunkered on every hole.Golfers playing from the White tees may want to change up and play from the Blues on some holes that feature elevated tees. This includes holes No. 11 and No. 18, where playing from the short White tees can actually make for an uphill tee shot. No. 11 is a par-5 that ranks as the #2 handicap-hole, and plays to 523 yards from the Bues, and 480 yards from the White tees. No. 18 is a par-4 that plays to 426 yards from the Blue tees and 390 from the White.Other interesting holes include No. 2 and No. 10, both par-4s that play to less than 300 yards from the White tees. Another unique Pete Dye feature is the back-to-back par-5s, Nos. 6 and 7. These two holes are considered a good scoring opportunity, although the tee shot on No. 7 can be a bit daunting.The course has received a number of honors and accolades since re-opening, including being awarded 4? stars by Golf Digest Places to Play, and being ranked the #1 public course in Indiana by Golfweek Magazine.Practice facilities include a large, targeted grass driving range, putting green and short-game area with sand bunkers. Private and group golf lessons are also available.  The resort also features a full-service clubhouse with a fully stocked Golf Shop, locker rooms, and The Garrison Restaurant.

Between 1926 and 1927, the museum changed locations to the home of Mary Stewart Carey and between 1946 and 1976, the museum relocated to the St. Clair Parry mansion. In 1976, the original building was demolished and a new facility was constructed and is still in use.The museum boasts a collection of over 100,000 artifacts and the collection is a powerhouse of ideas and concepts. Since 1926, the museum has increased the size of its collection and is now divided into three domains; the Natural World Collection, the Cultural World and the American Experience Collection. The collections are important because the artifacts tell the complete story of generation to generation and are a reference point for children to assimilate their lives with other people of different time periods and cultures.The museum has highlights that visitors find interesting and enjoyable. The Polar Bear which was acquired in 1965, journeyed from the Bering Strait to find its home on the second floor of the museum. The Reuben Wells is a 55-ton steam engine that is 35 feet long, and sits in the center of the All Aboard exhibit. The Carousel was acquired in 1976 and the animals were handcrafted by Gustav Dentzel in the 20th century. Other exhibits of interest are the Mastodon, the Water Clock and the Supercroc.The museum is open daily during normal business hours; however, the museum has special holiday hours that should be taken into consideration when planning a visit. Guests can enjoy a gift shop, snack bars and a cafy. The first Thursday of every month is family night, with special events and activities many people enjoy.

Charlotte,Independence Boulevard in Charlotte,"Independence Boulevard has a history of being the first urban highway in Charlotte, North Carolina. The highway consist of the I-485 (The Outerbelt), Interstates 85 and 77, and the Belk and Brookshire Freeways (I-277). The planning of the highway in the 1940's gave the city of Charlotte the boost that it needed to start transforming from a small town into an urban city. The former mayor at the time, Ben Douglas, pushed for the construction of Independence Boulevard and in 1946 secured the funding needed to start building the highway. The highway did not reach full completion until the mid 1950's.The history of Independence Boulevard can be seen in much of its infrastructure. Facilities and stores built in the 1950's stand on each side of the highway, many are in need of restoration or have become completely vacant. Over the last decade, Independence Boulevard has seen an emergence of car dealerships, small strip mall areas, and fast food restaurant chains. Large retailers have moved away from the boulevard and left behind struggling businesses. Residents are hoping for a revitalization of the boulevard that was once buzzing with vibrant activity. For now, the road is definitely not a tourist attraction and visitors to the city have no other reason to head to the boulevard unless they are planning a visit to a specialty store or restaurant along the street. Independence is not walkable or scenic which keeps it off the list of Charlotte's top attractions.Many of the struggling owners that are holding tightly onto their business can remember the days when the boulevard was filled with businesses and shoppers. The once booming Coliseum Center situated right off Independence feels like a ghost town with boarded stores and vacant parking lots. Many business owners on Independence Boulevard feel the economy of the road took a turn for the worst in 2002 when construction on the boulevard turned the street into a highway and took away its reputation as a boulevard for shopping. The City of Charlotte defends its plans to turn Independence Boulevard into a freeway and promises that the end result will be economic stability and growth of the neighborhoods that are situated off of Independence. Not all businesses are going downhill because of the construction that has overtaken the famous boulevard.Over the last few decades changes have transformed the structure of Independence Boulevard and the role it plays in the organization of Charlotte. Pieces of the streets have been renamed after the intersecting avenue and area. For example, in 2007, the southern portion of Independence Boulevard was renamed Charlottetowne Avenue.Independence Boulevard in Charlotte still stands as one of the main roads in Charlotte and residents in the Southeast use the road in order to make their way into downtown. Because of the heavy use of the road, traffic and congestion are problems yet to be solved by the city's highway commission. The boulevard serves as one of the main arteries into the city - for many drivers, Independence is the first street they see when they come into Charlotte."
Charlotte,"Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte, NC","The Levine Museum of the New South in Charlotte North Carolina is a place residents and visitors can explore the history of the Carolina Piedmont area. The museum preserves and collects several objects that have been a part of the North Carolina history. The goal of the museum is education. The name of the museum may seem a little strange for anyone who has not lived in the south. ""New South'' means the time after the Civil War or the War Between the States. Artifacts in the museum will date from 1865 to the present. Levine Museum provides a history museum in which patrons can engage in the history.The Civil War was more than a fight to end slavery. It was also a way to reach further in economics, politics, and culture. The South had to reinvent themselves since it was the southern states that still had slavery. The war changed how societies interacted and how new individuals were accepted. Change in the south took a long time, even after the war. Through the museum an attendee can see the gradual change, the effects it had, and how different races began to interact.Museum Admission and Hours:The museum is open 7 days a week. Monday through Saturday hours are 10am to 5pm. Sundays the museum opens at noon and closes at 5pm. The museum is closed for all major holidays.Admission for adults is $6.00. Children and seniors are $5.00. For a group of individuals the museum charges $4.00. A family can enter the premises for $17.00.Exhibits:Their permanent exhibit is the Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers. This exhibit showcases the southern movement from plantations to larger financial businesses. Plantations in the south were the main means of survival. Plantations were for growing cotton, crops, and tobacco. While they certainly had empires of businesses, the financial centers in the south were nothing like what New York City was becoming. Today Charlotte as well as other major southern cities are financial powerhouses. The Levine Museum allows a patron to see this.There are two temporary exhibits at the museum: Changing Places and Standing on a Box. The Changing Places exhibit will be showcased for a year, ending in 2010. Standing on a Box is only at the museum for 3 months. The exhibit will leave in June 2009. Changing Places is based on the New South as it is today. The display discusses the growth of Charlotte North Carolina as one of the top places to live. Individuals from New York, Mexico, Bosnia, Vietnam, and other places have moved into Charlotte in the last nineteen years. It is about the blending of cultures. The South has been catalogued as an isolated area in the US, yet that is changing now.Standing on a Box is a different style of display. It is based on Lewis Hine, a photographer, who obtained photographs of children working in textile mills. The images created a controversy and helped change child labor laws."

Charlotte,Zuma Fun Center in Charlotte,"Zuma Fun Center is the second largest operation of fun centers in the United States. The centers have sixteen locations across nine states including Texas, Arizona, California, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The Charlotte location of the Zuma Fun Center borders on a suburb of the city called Pineville-Matthews.The Zuma Fun Center is a great place to go for family fun and entertainment. It is located on the South side of Charlotte and is a popular attraction for locals and tourists. Locals that are familiar with the Zuma Fun Center location are aware of its former name. The center was formally called The Celebration Station. The new Zuma Fun Center has six main attractions that are appealing to children of all ages.The main six attractions include the kiddie rides, batting cages, video arcade room, bumper boats, go-karts, and miniature golf. The miniature golf is a total of 18 holes to test both patience and ability. The Go-Karts give visitors a chance to race around a track. Racers can drive along side with other drivers over long stretches and wide curves. One of the major complaints of customers who have attended the Zuma Fun Center has to do with the height requirements for pre-teen children who are not tall enough to drive a go-kart. Children who do not meet the height requirements to ride in a go-kart can still have the opportunity to experience the ride if they are accompanied by a parent who drives.The largest section of the Zuma Fun Center has a huge arcade at the center. The arcade area of the facility has a variety of interactive and competitive games. Many of the games in the arcade release tickets that can be redeemed for prizes. The tickets received from the game are contingent on how well a contestant scores while playing.On the last Friday of every month the center has an event called Fellowship knights. Fellowship Nights are a great bargain for families to use the bumper boats, kiddies rides, go-karts and miniature golf course. From 4:00PM until the center closes - families have unlimited use of the rides and go-kart course for only $15. The Zuma Fun Center is open Monday through Friday from 4:00PM to 9:00PM. On Saturday to Sunday the center is open from noon to 7:00PM.One of the most popular features of the Zuma Fun Center are the birthday party celebrations. There are three birthday packages that can be purchased for groups of six or more. The three packages are the Basic Party, Spectacular Party, and Ultimate Party. All parties include two slices of pizza and a soft drink for each guest. Gift cards are also available and can be recharged with tokens.Go-karts, miniature golf, batting cages, and other interactive games, sports, and rides are all available at the Zuma Fun Center. An all day fun pass is available to visitors or they can pay individually for each attraction at the center. Group packages are also available for guests of fifteen or more."
Detroit,"Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory - Detroit, Michigan - 13-acre garden with greenhouse on Belle Isle","The Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is a 13-acre botanical garden with greenhouse located on Belle Isle in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Built in 1904, it is the oldest conservatory in the country. Designed by Albert Kahn, a well-known architect, the original conservatory was rebuilt between 1952 to 1954. At that point the building, which had been made of wood, was given a new skeleton of steel and other metal. In 1953, the Conservatory was renamed for Anna Scripps Whitcomb, a Detroit native who bequeathed her collection of 600 orchid plants to the city.With Whitcomb's gift and other generous donations, the Anna Cripps Whitcomb Conservatory now houses one of the largest and most varied collections of orchids in the United States. In fact, the reputation of the Whitcomb Conservatory was so well-known that during World War II, rare orchid specimens that were rescued from the bombing in Great Britain were taken to the conservatory for preservation.The greenhouse that houses the orchid collection, which is owned by the city of Detroit, is set in a 13-acre botanical garden. The conservatory takes up more than an acre of the gardens, and includes two wings and a separate house. One wing houses tropical plants like bananas, coffee, orchids, and oranges. The opposite wing houses an extensive collection of desert plants, including cacti, succulents and ferns. The central dome, which is 85 feet high, contains a show house which features a display of flowering plants.In addition to the conservatory itself, the grounds include formal gardens of perennials, a lily pond garden and a formal rose garden. The gardens and grounds are a popular venue for weddings and events, and attracts professional and amateur photographers from around the area.While the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is owned and operated by the city of Detroit, the Belle Isle Botanical Society is one of its strongest supporters. Founded in 1988, the BIBS is dedicated to preserving and providing ongoing maintenance and renovation at the Conservatory. It works with the city to raise funds and make necessary renovations and repairs. Since 2005, BIBS has managed to raise the money needed to replace or repair all the glass in the conservatory and the greenhouse.Belle Isle Park, home to the Conservatory, is the largest island park in the country, and is larger than Central Park. It is located in the middle of the Detroit River, and connected to the city by MacArthur Bridge. In addition to the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, Belle Isle is also home to the Detroit Yacht Club, a Nature Center, the Detroit Boat Club, a swimming beach, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum and a municipal golf course. The park was designed and landscaped in the 1880s by renowned park architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed the Arnold Arboretum, Central Park and the grounds of the United States Capital.The Conservatory is open 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, including holidays, and admission is free. For information on hours, admission or to book events at the Conservatory, contact the Conservatory directly at (313) 628-2081, or via TTY at (313) 224-4636."
Detroit,"Belle Isle - Detroit, Michigan - island park and tourist attraction","Belle Isle is an island park in Detroit, Michigan. At just under 1,000 acres, it is the largest park in the country to cover a complete island, and this island is the third largest island in the Detroit River. The 2.42 square mile island is home to a number of recreational spots managed by the Detroit Recreation Department, including the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory and a small golf course.Belle Isle was originally colonized by French settlers in the 1700s and was at one point a private estate. Once known as Hog Island, the island got its current name in 1845. In the 1880s, at the height of the movement to beautify urban landscapes with formally planned parks, Belle Isle was landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted, a well-known urban landscaper, was also the designer of Central Park and the Arnold Arboretum in Boston.Between the time that the island was landscaped and the mid-1900s, a number of buildings and structures were added to the island. In 1887, architects John Donaldson and Henry Meier designed and built a Queen Anne style casino building on the west end of the island. When the casino was destroyed by fire, the city chose Albert Kahn to design its replacement. The Renaissance style brick and terra cotta building was built in 1908, and is still used for weddings and events today. Kahn also designed and built the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, the oldest public conservatory in the country.For years, Belle Isle was home to a herd of fallow deer, a children's zoo and an aquarium, but the city closed the animal facilities due to budget problems. The island still offers many recreational opportunities.Belle Isle is connected to the city of Detroit by the MacArthur Bridge. It is home to a number of leisure and entertainment amenities. They include the Detroit Botanical Gardens and the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, which houses one of the country's most extensive collections of orchids. In addition, it is home to the a yacht club, a boat club, a municipal golf course, a Coast Guard post, and the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. There is a half-mile long swimming beach, and a Nature Center, as well as several miles of hiking trails, including wheelchair accessible hiking trails. Visitors to the island can also take advantage of picnic tables, a playground, baseball fields, basketball courts and tennis courts. Finally, the island is the site of a street race circuit that hosts races in the IndyCar Series and the ALMS.The James Scott Fountain located on Belle Isle was designed by New York architect Cass Gilbert. The fountain was built in 1925 with a special bequest from infamous gambler, James Scott, who left $500,000 to the city with instructions to use the money to build a fountain on Belle Isle. There was only one condition - that a life-size statue of the donor be built beside the new fountain. The statue of James Scott sits in a chair facing beside the fountain, looking out toward the city. Belle Isle Park is open daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Admission is free."
Detroit,"Comerica Park - Detroit, MI - Detroit Tigers baseball stadium","Since April 11, 2000, Detroit's Major League Baseball team, the Tigers, has called Comerica Park home. Prior to playing in Comerica Park, the Tigers played at ""The Corner'' - their famous stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. Although many fans were initially skeptical, as The Corner had been a park of Tigers history for over 100 years, Comerica Park has now been embraced by most as an asset to the team.Plans for Comerica Park began long before the doors actually opened. After years of planning and budgeting, construction crews broke ground in October of 1997. The design, sometimes debated, continued to evolve as it was built, and Tigers owner Mike Illitch played a large role in the decision-making. In the end, Comerica Park cost over $300 million to complete, but most of the people involved in the project have noted they are happy with the classic ballpark feel combined with unique Detroit elements. The name for the park was decided in 1998, when Comerica Incorporated gave the Tigers $66 million in exchange for naming rights.Comerica Park is more than just a baseball field. However, although fans can visit a number of other buildings that are a part of the park, none of these outlying buildings obstruct the view from the stadium itself. The ballpark has no upper deck outfield seats either, giving fans the optimal view of the game and the Detroit downtown skyline. They have one of the largest scoreboards in professional baseball and a sunken field for the best view of the game. The stadium was built so that it could someday have a retractable roof, should they decide to add it.Along with Tigers administrative offices, Comerica Park had over 70,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space that fans can peruse prior to or following a game. The concourses in this stadium are much wider than those in an average MLB ballpark, and as visitors make their way through the main concourse, they can visit the Walk of Fame. Designers have created a timeline, complete with decade monuments, which reach from floor to ceiling. There are plans to continue with this historical part of the park in the future, as the Tigers meet new goals.Comerica Park has a number of unique features that aren't found in any other MLB parks. First, in their food court, fans of any age can ride their carousel, which has tigers to ride instead of horses. They also have a baseball-inspired Ferris wheel. Most interesting to many of their fans, however, is the water fountain. Called ""Liquid Fireworks,'' these spraying fountains are located in center field. The ballpark stages shows with their fountains synchronized to music. When a Tiger team member hits a home run, two tigers on the scoreboard roar and the center field fountains shoot into the air.Ticket price depend on the games being played, the time of year, and the location of the seat. There are many seating options available including premium seats in the on-deck circle, tiger den, infield box, terrace, outfield box, and club seats. Comerica Park has seating capacity of bearkt 42,000. To learn more or schedule a tour of the facility visitors can call 313-471-2074, and to purchase tickets to a game at Comerica Park, fans can call 1-866-66-TIGER."
Detroit,"The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel - Detroit, Michigan - underwater border crossing into Canada from Michigan","The Detroit-Windsor tunnel is one of the busiest and most important border crossings between the United States and Canada. It also has the distinction of being the only vehicular underwater border crossing between two countries anywhere in the world. An estimated 28,000 vehicles take the mile long trip under the Detroit River every day, which means around 9 million vehicles cross into Canada or the United States at this location every year.As far back as 1870, Detroit engineers were considering a tunnel or a bridge to link the cities of Detroit and Windsor. Several attempts to build a tunnel were actually made in the late 19th century; all were abandoned for various reasons, including prohibitive costs and the discovery of harmful gases. The growth of the car industry in the early 20th century made it clear that a tunnel for road traffic was necessary.Construction proper began on the tunnel in 1928, after sufficient funding was made available by a group of Detroit bankers and a New York architectural firm verified that the tunnel would be both possible and profitable. Work commenced on both the US and the Canadian ends of the tunnel simultaneously using several different methods - a major engineering feat at the time. Construction also involved the difficult task of sinking nine steel tubes into a trench in the riverbed.The tunnel cost of around 23 million dollars and was completed in 1930, a year ahead of schedule. President Hoover dedicated the tunnel on November 1st 1930, in a ceremony from Washington that rang bells in both Detroit and Windsor to officially declare the tunnel open. Two days later, on November 3rd, 1930, the first cars made their way through the tunnel.One of the most impressive features of the tunnel is its innovative system to pump fresh air in to the tunnel; in fact the air inside is cleaner than the air at street level. Tall ventilation towers at both ends of the tunnel contain huge fans and are each responsible for ventilating half of the tunnel. The system is so effective that the air in the tunnel is changed completely every 90 seconds.Apart from the volume of traffic that it handles, the tunnel's other statistics are just as impressive. During its construction, an estimated 80,000 cubic yards of concrete were used, as well as almost 12,000 tons of steel and 50 miles of electrical cables. The interior of the tunnel is illuminated by almost 600 lights and contains 250,000 wall tiles. At any one time, up to 600 laborers worked on its construction.Today, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel provides a fast and convenient link between the US and Canada. The tunnel is jointly owned by both cities and efforts are continually being made to improve the overall travel experience. In 1993, a major renovation program costing $50 million was launched; work included improvements to lighting, the road surface and the stone covering. Current improvements are concentrating on allowing customers to pay the toll electronically, thus reducing wait times at the tolls and helping to improve traffic flow."
Detroit,"The Detroit Opera House - Detroit, Michigan - century-old opera house in Detroit","Throughout its almost 100 years of existence, the Detroit Opera House has enjoyed a distinguished history. In addition to being the permanent home of the Michigan Opera Theater, it has also been host to many famous names, such as Louis Armstrong, Luciano Pavarotti and Roy Orbison. Today, it is considered to be one of the best venues in the Midwest to see world class opera and dance.The building was designed by the local architect C. Howard Crane and opened in 1922 as the Capitol Theater. The huge building could seat up to 4,250 people and was the fifth largest theater in the world at the time. Crane, who also designed Detroit's Fox Theater, intended that the building would be as stylish as any opera house in Europe, with lavish and beautiful fittings and excellent acoustics.The interior of the building is even more impressive than the exterior and many of the features are still intact today. Crane designed the building in the Italian Renaissance style and included such touches as marble staircases, brass fixtures and chandeliers. He also made dark red one of the predominant interior colors; the draperies and the curtain on the main stage were constructed from Italian damask.Throughout the 1920s and 30s the building changed its name several times; and by the 1950s was in a state of disrepair. After renovations, it re-opened in 1960 as the Grand Circus Theater, only to close again eighteen years later. Its future was assured when the Michigan Opera Theater purchased the building in 1988 and beginning in 1996 put on a program of regular events, including five dance productions and five opera productions each year.During the last few years, the Detroit Opera House has staged productions of some of the world's best known operas, including La Boheme, Porgy and Bess and The Barber of Seville. Past ballet productions have included Romeo and Juliet and Sleeping Beauty. A comprehensive program of special events has included such diverse offerings as Chinese dance, a comedy tour and a blues festival. The Opera House has also worked hard to make opera more accessible to all; a new program called Access tries to make opera and dance more enjoyable and affordable for young people.In addition to offering a wide program of events, the Opera House also offers visitors guided tours; it's a chance to go behind the scenes and learn about the building's history and ongoing restoration. The Opera House also has a comprehensive program of state wide educational visits and workshops as well as a program in which volunteers assist with the various aspects of production.The Opera House is located in the heart of downtown Detroit, overlooking Grand Circus Park in an area of the city known as the Theater District. The well known Fox Theater is a short distance away and there is a good selection of hotels and restaurants within walking distance; some area restaurants even provide free shuttle service to the Opera House."
Detroit,"Detroit People Mover - Detroit, Michigan - light rail transportation through downtown Detroit","The Detroit People Mover is one of very few light rail public transit systems in the United States. The 2.9-mile track serves thirteen stations in downtown Detroit, making it easy to move around the downtown Detroit area. It is modeled on the same technology that operates the SkyTrain system in Vancouver and Toronto's Scarborough RT line. Although it has a daily ridership capacity of 288,000, the daily average ridership of the People Mover is about 7,500.Opened in 1987, the Detroit People Mover is an urban mass transit system which operates on a single track in downtown Detroit. The fully automated system was built to move up to 15 million people annually, but operates far below capacity at around 2 million people a year.The People Mover grew from 1966 legislation that allocated funds for the development of urban mass transit systems and created an administration, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, to oversee the development of new types of mass transportation. Nine years later, with no notable results, the UMTA offered federal funds to cover most of the construction and startup costs of Downtown People Movers. While Detroit was not chosen as one of the winning proposals for those funds, the UMTA recommended that that city, along with Baltimore and Miami, be allowed to construct People Mover systems if they could do so without using new federal monies to do so. The four cities that won federal grant money to build People Mover systems eventually dropped out of the program, as did Baltimore, but Detroit and Miami went on to build People Mover light rail systems for their downtown areas. The People Mover opened in 1986 and has been in continuous operation since, though parts of it have been shut down during various construction projects in the city.The People Mover runs in a continuous clockwise circuit of thirteen stations. Six of the stations are built into existing buildings. Each station is embellished with original art, and provides access to a different part of the downtown area.The Times Square Station serves as home base for the People Mover. It houses the Detroit Transportation Corporation Operations Center and Maintenance Facility. Other stations include the Michigan Avenue Station, the Fort/Cass Station, the Cobo Center Station, the Joe Louis Arena Station, the Financial District, the Millender Center Station, the Renaissance Center Station, the Bricktown Station, the Greektown Station, the Cadillac Center Station, and the Broadway Station. Grand Circus Park Station is the final stop on the thirteen-station track. It is in the center of Detroit's newly renovated sports and theater district. All of these stations provide access to the most popular parts of the city's downtown area.The People Mover runs seven days a week, with varying hours. Monday through Friday, the trains run from 6:30 AM to midnight. Fridays, they run from 6:30 AM to 2:00 AM. Saturdays the trains run from 9:00 AM to 2:00 AM, and Sunday they run from noon to midnight. Fares for all rides are fifty cents."
Detroit,"Detroit Historical Museum - Detroit, MI - museum chronicling Detroit's history","In 1928, the Detroit Historical Society opened the Detroit Historical Museum, which today is one of the oldest and largest city museums in the United States. With over 600 items on display, this is considered one of the premier tourist destinations in Detroit's Cultural Center. There are over 80,000 square feet of exhibitions in this museum.The Detroit Historical Museum features both permanent and temporary displays. Their signature display is called Streets of Old Detroit. The museum advertises this as the most memorable exhibit in the museum. They've recreated the streets of the city as they looked in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Visitors can even go inside one of the shops, which is set up to look like a store from this time period. Along with recreated pieces, this shop includes real historical items, including artifacts that date back to the 1840s.Another popular exhibit in the Detroit Historical Museum is named The Motor City. This display, which was opened in 1995, celebrates the city's automotive industry. It starts with the opening of Detroit's car factories and follows the timeline of these companies to their presence in Detroit today.The Detroit Historical Museum also has the Frontiers to Factories exhibit as a permanent display, which chronicles the city's history before the car industry was even a dream in people's minds. Tourists can see pictures, artifacts, and more from this era. Nearby, some of the other exhibits visitors might like to see include 1920s: Detroit's Building Boom, Hero or Villain?

Throughout these displays, visitors can read the story of this city and view hundreds of artifacts. Tours are available for groups, or visitors can walk through the museum on their own.One of these artifacts is a clock build by Louis Meier, Sr., a skilled clockmaker who lived and worked in Detroit. Called the ""Wonderful Clock,'' Meier's clock is carved with intricate details and gives guests a great photographic opportunity whenever it rings. When he built it, the clock was used to advertise his jewelry store, which was located on the corner of East Grand Boulevard and Gratiot in downtown Detroit.The Detroit Historical Museum is a part of an entire collection of research and artifacts that are owned by the Detroit Historical Society. In addition to this museum, they also run the Dossin Great Lakes Museum and a collection of over 200,000 items relating to this area of Michigan.

Detroit,"Detroit Zoo - Royal Oak, MI - animal zoo, preservation, and research center","Just north of the Detroit city limits, tourists can visit the Detroit zoo, which is home to almost 7,000 animals. With over 270 species, including some endangered species, this zoo is one of the largest and most popular in the area. They also work to protect, preserve, and research the animal species represented at this zoo.The Detroit Zoo was founded in 1883. At this point, it was located on Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, which is across the street from Comerica Park, the Tigers ballpark. In the 1880s, a circus came to Detroit, but while there, it went bankrupt. A Detroit philanthropist purchased the animals and started the zoo. Just a year later, the zoo closed, but in 1911, a society formed to reopen it. That occurred in 1928, when the zoo moved to Royal Oak, and Detroit became the first city in the United States to have a ""cageless'' zoo. Some of the earliest exhibits, which still exist today, include Bear Den, Baboon Rock, the Reptile House, the Giraffe Encounter, and the Elk Exhibit.Today, some of the most popular exhibits are those centered on the zoo's Species Survival Plans or SSPs. American SSPs were first developed in the 1980s, and they are meant to help ensure the survival of species in zoos and aquariums. Some of the endangered species at the Detroit Zoo include trumpeter swans, partula snails, polar bears, and wolverines. However, there are some animals that visitors will not find at the zoo. In 2005, they became the first zoo in the country to voluntarily give animals to another zoo on ethical grounds. They admitted that Michigan winters are too cold for these animals and it wasn't right to keep them indoors confined for months on end. Since then, other northern zoos have also relocated some of their animals.One of the most popular exhibits at the Detroit Zoo is the Arctic Ring of Life, which first opened in 2001 and is the world's largest polar bear exhibit. The bears have a 300,000-gallon aquarium that has a 70-foot long, 12-foot tall tunnel, which is made of four-inch thick clear acrylic walls.

This exhibit covers two acres and has both red kangaroos and wallabies. Visitors walk through the area on a designated path, but there are only small wire fences separating the trails from the habitat, so the animals can hop around freely, even when guests are on the trail.Along with viewing animals, visitors can ride the park's railroad, participate in animal feeding demonstrations, and go on picnics in any of the designated areas.

Detroit,"Detroit Zoological Park in Detroit, Michigan","Opened in 1883, the first Detroit Zoo was located on Michigan and Trumball Avenue, across from the current Tigers Stadium. A circus arrived in Detroit and went bankrupt, Luther Beecher a leading Detroit businessman, financed the purchase of the circus animals and erected a facility for their display and called it Detroit Zoological Park. The facility was closed the following year and converted into a horse auction house. Although the Detroit Zoological Society was founded in 1911, the zoo did not officially open until August 1st, 1928.In 1930, Bears Den and Sheep Rock were added to the facility and were followed by the addition of the Bird House. The Elk Exhibit, Baboon Rock, Primate and Reptile Houses were constructed a short time later. The Detroit Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to feature cage-less exhibits throughout the facility.Though the Great Depression put a temporary stay on further construction and expansion, the zoo resumed and has continued to grow since then. In 1939, Corrado Parducci, a sculptor, created the Horace Rackman Memorial Fountain, more commonly known as the ""Bear Fountain'', which marked the first of four major donations made by Mary Rackman, in honor of her late husband.Other exhibits include the Arctic Ring of Life, a $14.9 million interactive facility composed of 4-acres devoted to showcasing the relationship between people of the Arctic and wildlife. Amphibiville is a display dedicated to amphibians from around the world and is the home of the National Amphibian Conservation Center. The African Grasslands exhibit is designed to inform visitors about the unique ecosystem and native animals of Africa.The Australian Outback Adventure allows visitors to walk through an actual habitat and get up-close to native Australian wildlife. The Wild Adventure ride is the first zoo-based virtual reality voyage and allows guests to experience an educational, action-packed ride centered on wildlife.

Before she went to the junkyard, the Dossin Historical Society raised money to buy the Gothic Room, which was essentially moved and restored in the museum. This is a popular location for special events and weddings, as it can be rented during non-museum hours.Another maritime fixture that moved to the museum instead of being scrapped is the SS William Clay Ford pilot house. This freighter transported metals on the Great Lakes, typically from the River Rouge Steel Plant to the Ford Motor Company. It was scrapped in 1987, and at this point the entire pilot house was moved and reconstructed in the museum.The L is for Lighthouse exhibit is another important and popular part of the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. Located in DeRoy Hall, this exhibit highlights the lighthouses of the Great Lakes region, recording their locations, navigational and lighting features, and more. There are also artifacts that chronicle the lives of the men and women who worked and, in some cases, lived in these structures, and there is a collection of lenses in this museum from lighthouses around the Great Lakes area.There are a number of other permanent and temporary exhibits located at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. This location is well known for their collection of ship models, which are rotated at least once a year. There's also a collection of signal flags, along with an exhibit about Detroit's growth in conjunction with the River and an exhibit on Bob-Lo Island.When visiting this museum, guests can explore the exhibits on their own or they can join a tour to learn more about the Detroit area's maritime history from one of the museum's knowledgeable staff members. School tours are available for teachers or home school groups, and they also have tours available for families, church groups, senior citizen centers, and other organizations that are interested in guided tours.The museum is available to host special events, and they also have a number of annual events every year, including the Great Lakes Shipwreck Festival, which features special exhibits, sessions on the shipwrecks in the Great Lakes areas, and other events in conjunction with the Ford Seahorses Scuba Diving Club.

Detroit,"Eastern Market - Detroit, Michigan - fresh foods market covering an entire neighborhood in Detroit","Detroit's Eastern Market is so large that it is more of a neighborhood than just an actual market. The huge complex of sheds and warehouses located close to downtown dates from the 1850s and covers around 43 acres. In fact, it is the largest historic public market district in the United States. The Eastern Market is a big attraction for both residents and visitors and is home to about 175 vendors.The city's first farmer's market was opened in Cadillac Square Detroit in 1841 and it initially sold mostly wood and hay; it was moved to its present location in 1891. As the market grew in popularity, additional sheds were built to accommodate vendors. After WWII, more food processors and wholesalers began to move in and the market became a major hub for wholesale food distribution.Overseeing the huge complex is the Eastern Market Corporation (EMC), whose goal is to ensure that the market is the major center for fresh food in southeast Michigan. The corporation does this in several ways: maintaining the market's unique identity, taking advantage of any economic incentives that might be available, and ensuring that streets, buildings, and open spaces are appealing and user-friendly. Over 100 people live in the Eastern Market; future plans call for up to 600 residents.The place to go for meat of all kinds is Gratiot Central Market. This building was built in 1915, but almost completely rebuilt in 1995, following a major fire. In addition to the usual poultry, pork, and beef, more unusual meats can be found here, including rabbit, goat, homemade sausage, and even Amish chicken. The market's bakery serves over 20 different varieties of pie.Although fresh produce and meats are perhaps the main attractions at eastern Market, there are other reasons to visit. The Artisan Village was created as a showcase for local artists and craftsmen to display and sell their work, and there are also several antique shops, art galleries, and hardware stores. Visitors can also learn something of the history of the market by taking a walking tour; these are held every Saturday morning during the summer months.The market has a program of events throughout the year, but one of the most popular is Flower Day, held every May. Flower Day features hundreds of vendors from Michigan and surrounding states exhibiting and selling flowers, trees, shrubs, and tropical plants. The festival is attended by an estimated 150,000 people every year and is one of the largest flower shows anywhere in the country; it's also the unofficial start of Detroit's summer season.The Eastern Market area is every day except Sunday, although Saturday tends to be the busiest day. It's estimated that around 45,000 people visit on a typical Saturday. In addition to the many shops, there are restaurants serving everything from fast food to Ethiopian cuisine. It is located about a mile northeast of downtown and is within easy reach of other neighborhoods such as the Riverfront and Lafayette Park. In 1978 the entire area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places."
Detroit,"Ford Field - Detroit, MI - Detroit Lions football stadium","Ford Field has been the home stadium of the Detroit Lions, Michigan's professional football team, since August of 2002. This stadium is also used for concerts, college sports games, and other events when not being used by the Lions. The decision was made in 1996, when the team announced their intentions to build a new domed stadium adjacent to Comerica Park, the new Detroit Tigers baseball park. In November of that year, Wayne County voters approved the plans overwhelmingly, and construction began in 1999 with a Lions groundbreaking ceremony at which they announced the stadium's name and the design plans.The Ford Field complex covers nearly 1.8 million square feet, which includes the field itself, seating, and ground level restaurants, concessions, and stores. Costing over $500 million to complete, this stadium is unique in that it incorporated an existing historical building in its design. Hudson's Warehouse is part of the stadium and includes room for banquets, office space, food courts, a lounge, and all of the private suits. A seven-story atrium in the warehouse gives fans a view overlooking the city of Detroit. Overall, many experts believe that Ford Field has the best views of any United States football stadium. Along with the atrium, there are no high-level club and suite seats, so the upper level is lower, giving fans watching the game a great view of the city as well. This is keeping with the design of neighboring Comerica Park, which is also known for its low upper level and great views.Ford Field has 65,000 seats for fans, including 8,500 club seats that come with private lounges, food service, and preferred parking. There are 132 suites, with a capacity of 8 to 30 people, depending on the type of suite. Most of these suites are located in the warehouse. There are seven gated entrances to the stadium, leading to 32 main entrance doors, and players make use of 11 different locker rooms.There are a number of rental options for those wishing to hold events at Ford Field. These include the Hall of Legends banquet room, the South Cove reception area, the Atrium, the Adams Street reception area on the Main Concourse level, and, of course, the Detroit Lions playing field itself. Levy Restaurants, the food service company that runs all of the concessions and restaurants at Ford Field, is available to cater any booked event.Ford Field also has leasing options for Detroit businesses that want to relocate to the Ford Field complex. From 1913 to 1995, the warehouse was adjacent to a number of Hudson Department Stores. They have now been renovated to allow modern business to move in, and they already provide covered parking for customers, elevators, ATMs, and a coffee shop and cafy.For visitors interested in getting to know more about Ford Field, both public and private tours are available. From June to December, public walk-up tours are given at 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and from January to May they are given at the same times on just Mondays and Fridays. No advance reservations are needed. Private tours for groups of 25 or more can be scheduled any time Monday through Friday, and they have weekend or evening tour time available for groups of 75 or more. Tours can be books by calling 313-262-2396."
Detroit,"GM Renaissance Center - Detroit, Michigan - skyscraper complex in downtown Detroit","Detroit's Renaissance Center is a historic complex of skyscrapers designed and built in the 1970s. Now known as the GM Renaissance Center, or more familiarly as the RenCen, the Renaissance Center was conceived as a project intended to revitalize downtown Detroit and return it from the brink of economic disaster. The complex consists of seven connected skyscrapers, all centered around the central tower, which houses the tallest all hotel tower in the Western Hemisphere. The only all hotel tower in the world that is taller is Singapore's Swissotel, The Stanford, built in 1986. Since 1977, the building now known as the Detroit Marriot at the Renaissance Center has held the honor of being the tallest building in Michigan.In addition to the central tower, the Renaissance Center consists of four 39 story office towers and two 21 story office towers. The bases of the four towers include five stories of retail space referred to as ""podium space''. When GM renovated the complex in 2001, they added a five story atrium known as the Wintergarden. The Wintergarden faces the International Riverfront and offers riverfront access and a view of Canada across the river.The project is entirely owned by General Motors, who rent space out to retail and commercial tenants. The central tower is fully occupied by the Marriot at the Renaissance Center, flagship hotel of the Marriot chain and the largest hotel in the chain. It boasts 1,298 rooms on 73 stories. The top three stories of the tower are occupied by the Matt Prentice Restaurant Group Coach Insignia. The restaurant, which once rotated a full 360 degrees to offer diners an ever changing view of the city, serves Coach wines, and is considered to be a world class dining experience.The Renaissance Center offers 5.5 million square feet of office, retail and entertainment space. In addition to the hotel and restaurant, it houses four movie theaters, a financial center, the Canadian and Japanese Consulates, four restaurants and an 1,100 seat food court.From McDonalds to veal steaks and salmon, the Renaissance Center offers a truly eclectic dining experience to visitors.

Detroit,"Greektown - Detroit, Michigan - historical district in downtown Detroit","Home to Greektown Casino, Greektown is a historic district located just outside downtown Detroit, Michigan. The area, which runs along Monroe Avenue between St. Antoine and Brush Streets, is largely commercial, and features a heavy concentration of Greek restaurants along with several churches and the Greektown Casino. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.The area that is known as Greektown today was originally settled by German immigrants in the 1830s. However, as the neighborhood matured, the first wave of immigrants moved to areas further out from downtown and were replaced by new Greek immigrants. Many of the new immigrants established businesses, including restaurants, stores, bakeries and coffee houses. As the area became more heavily commercialized, the residents moved out to more residential areas, but the businesses they'd established remained behind. By the mid-1960s, the once-thriving and busy residential neighborhood had become a few blocks of commercial buildings.In 1966, a group of concerned Greek businessmen approached the city with their concern that their neighborhood was in danger of disappearing. They organized the first annual Greek Festival to be held in the neighborhood, and worked with the mayor and the city to refurbish the neighborhood, installing new lighting and improving building exteriors. The Greek Festival ran for years until it grew too large. By the time it was discontinued, the Greektown neighborhood was well-established.Thanks to the efforts of the Greek community in Detroit, today's Greektown is one of the few remaining Victorian commercial neighborhoods in the city. The streets are lined with restaurants that serve authentic Greek cuisine, and traditional Greek music spills from the open doors of coffee houses, cafes and stores. The area has become a focal point of downtown and a destination in and of itself. While Greektown was originally predominantly Greek in flavor, recent years have seen the addition of Thai, Italian and Southern cuisines, giving the district a distinctly international flavor.Among the tenants of the historic neighborhood is the Greektown Casino, one of Detroit's three operating casinos. The Casino features over 100,000 square feet of gaming space that includes more than 2,500 slot machines, 67 table games, a VIP gaming area and a Poker Room. In addition to the Casino, the district features the Greektown Casino Hotel, billed as Detroit's newest hot hotel. The 30 story hotel is sheathed in translucent blue glass, standing out against the Detroit skyline. The hotel features 400 guest rooms including 2-3 bedroom suites. The hotel also features 25,000 square feet of meeting and convention space available for events.The best times to sample Greektown are during the annual Fourth of July festivities, when the area's ethnic pride is on full display, during the yearly Taste of Greece event held each August, and in the days surrounding Greek Easter. Greektown is one of the stops on the Detroit People Mover, making it an easy trip from anywhere in the city."
Detroit,"Joe Louis Arena, Detroit, Michigan, Storied Hockey and Entertainment Center","Nicknamed ""The Joe'' and ""JLA,'' Joe Louis Arena is a hockey arena and entertainment center located at 600 Civic Center Drive in Detroit, Michigan.  The arena is named after former heavyweight-champion boxer,JoeLouis , a nativeof Detroit.When the $57-million arena first opened in 1979, it was called ""Joe Louis Warehouse,'' perhaps because it appeared so spacious inside. The arena's dimensions are 328' x 550' x 85' high, which gives it approximately 12 million cubic feet of space. Its seating capacity is 20,066 (including suites), and that number expands to 20,338 for end-stageconcertsand21,152 for center-stage concerts.The arena's most noteworthy tenant is the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings, whose storied history includes 11 Stanley Cup championships and a consistent ranking from Financial World Magazine as one of the most valuable franchises in the NHL. As a tribute to that success and the passion of area fans, the city of Detroit has been dubbed ""Hockeytown.''A colorful local tradition involves tossing an octopus (proper hockey etiquette says it should be boiled with lemon and white wine) onto the ice at Red Wings playoff games for good luck. As the tradition, which began in 1952, goes, the octopus and its eight tentacles match the number of playoff wins originally needed for a championship. The unofficial mascot of the Red Wings is a purple octopus named ""Al,'' and two of the mascots hang from the arena rafters, symbolizing the sixteen playoff wins now needed to win the Stanley Cup.The arena is also home to a variety of entertainment events, such as the world-renowned Ringling Brothers & Barnum and Bailey Circus, the Tour of World Figure Skating Champions, The World's Toughest Rodeo, WWE professional wrestling, basketball games, and the college hockey championships.In addition, the arena is often the stage for concerts by performers such as Janet Jackson, Luther Vandross, Luciano Pavoarotti, Alice Cooper, Metallica, Bob Seger, and Nickelback, to name a few. It also played host to the historic 1980 Republican National Convention, which saw Ronald Reagan receive his party's nomination on the road to becoming president.The arena boasts eight dressing rooms, a 128-foot-long press area, an 18-foot-tall Sony Jumbotron video scoreboard, eight smaller computerized scoreboards, and facilities for live audio and video broadcasts. The arena also houses 86 premium suites, and, in 2008, introduced a 181-person private seating section, called the Comerica Bank Legend's Club, in the arena's southeast corner.The City of Detroit owns the arena, which is operated by Olympia Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ilitch Holdings, Inc. Mike and Marian Ilitch own Little Caesars Pizza - which began in 1959 with Little Caesars Pizza Treat in Garden City, Michigan - as well as the Detroit Red Wings and the Detroit Tigers.The arena is located adjacent toCoboHall in theDetroitRiver waterfrontdistrict. It is accessible by surface streets, as well as its ownstation on theDetroitPeople Mover.In recent years, a number of plans have emerged to replace the venerable arena, including proposals for the expansion of Cobo Hall that require JLA to be demolished. However, there is no firm plan for replacement or remodeling in place."
Detroit,"Masonic Temple - Detroit, Michigan - largest Masonic temple in the world","Located in downtown Detroit, the Detroit Masonic Temple is a large events venue that regularly hosts musical events, Broadway shows and other events. The historic building has been a part of the Detroit skyline since Thanksgiving Day, 1926, when it was dedicated. It is the largest Masonic Temple in the world, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980.The Temple is built around a 4,404-seat theater with a 55 by 100 foot stage, which is generally regarded as one of the finest theaters in the United States. In addition, the 14 story building houses 1,037 rooms and serves as headquarters for the fifty Detroit-area Masonic organizations.The Masonic Temple has a long and well-recorded history. The current Temple was built to replace the Detroit Masonic Temple built on Lafayette Boulevard in 1896. Despite years of careful planning, the organization outgrew its space there by 1908. The Masonic Order at first attempted to enlarge their current temple facility by purchasing land on either side of the structure, but by 1913 realized that the only solution was to purchase another site. Determined not to face the same problem in just a few years, the organization undertook a search and a building initiative that culminated in the purchase of land on Temple Street in downtown Detroit.Ground was broken for the Masonic Temple on Thanksgiving Day, 1920, and the cornerstone of the new Temple was laid on September 18, 1922, using the same tools that were used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol. The Temple was completed and dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1926, 30 years after the original Temple opened to the public. The Temple was built in three parts with three separate functions - the Ritualistic Tower, which houses the headquarters for most of the Masonic organizations in Detroit, the auditorium, which houses the theater and is intended for public use, and the Shrine Club. The center section of the Temple also houses public ballrooms and a Drill room which are used for conventions and events.The Detroit Masonic Temple is generally acknowledged to be one of the most complex and beautiful buildings in the United States. It consists of a 14 story Ritualistic Tower at one end, a 10 story Shrine Club at the other end, and between them, a 7 story Auditorium Building.

Detroit,"Model T Automotive Heritage Complex - Detroit, Michigan - historical automobile-themed complex","Detroit has long been known as a major center for car manufacturing and one of the best places in the city to get an idea of the important role the city played is to visit the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex, or T-Plex. The building was threatened with demolition when local zoning laws changed, until in 1997 preservationist Jerald Mitchell stepped in, thus ensuring its survival.Henry Ford was born just outside Detroit in 1863 and after becoming skilled at the repair of steam engines, developed a self-propelled vehicle in 1896. Ford formed his own company in 1901 and began to not only build cars, but also revolutionize the industrial world by paying his workers a fair wage. Ford's company purchased the building in 1904 and the famous Model T was introduced in 1908. Over the course of almost 20 years, over 15 million Model T Fords would be sold.In 2006, the plant was designated as a National Historic Landmark; the building is also a Michigan Historic site. Work continues constantly in an effort to restore and renovate as much of the building as possible - much of it done by volunteers. Almost a dozen committees are involved not only with restoration, but everything from loaning out cars to publishing a regular newsletter.The distinctive red brick building still retains many of its original fittings and details from the period, including windows and fire escapes. At the time of its construction, the building was an excellent example of efficient industrial construction. Ford introduced various measures aimed at preventing fire damage, including three firewalls and a 25,000-gallon water tank that fed a sprinkler system.But it is what is inside the building that attracts history buffs and car enthusiasts - in addition to a collection of Model T Ford cars, visitors also see the once secret and experimental room where the Model T was developed. Several other Ford cars were constructed here as well, including the underrated Ford Model N and the model K, considered a luxury car at the time.In addition to several intact cars, visitors to T-Plex also experience a unique look at how cars were made over a century ago. A major exhibit shows the famous Model T car during different stages of its assembly and explains how cars were manufactured before the invention of the moving assembly line. Other exhibits in the building tell the history of both the building and the autoworkers.The T-Plex complex is located in an area of Detroit that is also home to several other reminders of the city's importance in the car industry. During its heyday, the Piquette Avenue area was the home of the US auto industry and in addition to the T-Plex building there are several other fine examples of industrial buildings that were once the home of such well known names as Cadillac, Dodge and Studebaker. There are also several sites relating to Henry Ford in and around Detroit, including the Henry Ford Museum in the nearby suburb of Dearborn."
Detroit,"Moross House, Detroit, Michigan","In Detroit, Michigan there are a number of homes and businesses that have been around for more than a century. One particular place for residents and visitors to enjoy is the Moross House. This house is the oldest surviving brick home in Detroit. This factor alone is what places it on the National Register of Historic Places. It received this distinction in 1972. There are conflicting accounts as to when the house was actually built. Some believe the house was constructed in the 1840's by Christopher Moross, while others put it at 1855.Whether the 1840's is right or not, the house has been opened as a museum, with furniture and decorations based on the 1840's rather than the next decade. The house changed ownership throughout the many decades, eventually being purchased by the Detroit Historical Commission in the 1920's. It was restored in 1971 to 1973 to be opened up for visitors. It is also the current home of the Detroit Garden Center.The Garden Center is a non-profit organization. It provides tours of the house, the parlor and hallway. The people running the tours also offer education on garden activities. They focus on educating people regarding gardening, flowers, and the 1840's. There is a tour of the facility and the small garden area the Center has planted. At Christmas there are special open houses to show the old fashioned Christmas theme. The decorations are all relevant to the 1840's. The house is also open in February for an orchid display with a lecture and sale of the plants.The Moross House can be described as a three bay structure, much like a townhouse. It was built in the Federal Style when the Greek Revival was occurring. This means much of the house details are in the Greek Revival style. There are heavy stone lintels and sidelights. This works to transform the front of the house. The building is two stories in height with a river limestone foundation. The roof has parapets and is covered with wood shingles. The shingles have had to be replaced over the last century to keep it looking good and to keep rain damage to a minimum. The wood shingles are ordered to look like the originals. There are also two chimneys on the roof that offer a symmetrical appearance. On the rear of the house is a single story addition and one on the side of the house as well.The Anthropology Museum of Detroit did some work in 1969 with the Moross House. On a dig they excavated a couple of areas. During this period any materials found were excavated and taken to the museum where they are on display. The collection from the backyard provides a number of clues to the early history including how the land was used as a dump by those demolishing the neighboring home. Ceramics, clay pipe fragments, and porcelain items were found during the dig. Also Earthenware, Blue Edgeware, and Mochaware were found with the excavation of the land."

Detroit,"Motown Historical Museum - Detroit, MI - museum honoring the history of Motown music","Founded in 1985, the Motown Historical Museum celebrates the legacy of the Motown Record Corporation and its impact on United States culture during the 1960s. This museum is located in Detroit and attracts thousands of visitors every year. From the opening of Studio A to the innovative style of the Motown women, the Motown Historical Museum gives tourists exhibits on everything dealing with this musical style.Motown's story begins in 1959 when Berry Gordy, Jr. purchased a two- family flat in Detroit and called it Hitsville USA. Today, that flat is the basis of the museum. Visitors can see the home as it looked in 1959-1960, with the original master bedroom suite and living room furniture. While Motown was first getting off of the ground, their producers, musicians, and administrators sat around the dining room table to prepare records for shipping. Along with this table, visitors to the Motown Historical Museum can see the original Motown control room, which was used to record Motown Sound. Some of the songs recorded on this equipment include ""Shop Around'' and ""Please Mr. Postman.'' Even after Motown outgrew its Hitsville USA headquarters and moved to a larger building, some of its recording artists continued to make records in this studio.As Motown grew in popularity, so did the space they needed. Gordy and his family moved, and the company purchased 7 more houses in the neighborhood for their singers, songwriters, producers, and other employees. The Motown Historical Museum includes models of these buildings, which they used exclusively until moving to a high rise in downtown Detroit.Along with the equipment used to make this company one of the most successful record labels in history, tourists can see the original stage uniforms that were worn by some of Motown's biggest stars. In the exhibit ""Motown Style,'' the museum displays Michael Jackson's famous jeweled white glove and fedora, dresses worn by the Supremes, and outfits that were once designed for Brenda Holloway, among other costumes. Further memorabilia found at the Motown Historical Museum includes original sheet music, photos of Motown's stars in the recording studio, and promotional material from the early 1960s.One of the most innovative recording methods during this time was the use of Motown's Echo Room. When visiting the Motown Historical Museum, guests can play with the special effects processes used before electronics could manipulate the music. They used a hole in the ceiling to create reverb, as heard in songs such as ""Dancing in the Streets'' and ""Where Did Our Love Go,'' and today's tourists can sing and clap in this studio to get similar effects.Visitors to the Motown Historical Museum can view the exhibits themselves or participate in a guided tour. The museum offers tours regularly during normal hours, and larger groups can schedule private tours in advance. As this is a popular destination for all age groups, the museum also offers special tours for school classes, church organizations, family reunions, and other groups.

Detroit,"New Detroit Science Center - Detroit, MI - science and technology learning center and museum","Home to the state's only IMAX Dome Theatre, the New Detroit Science Center is located in Detroit's Cultural Center, an area that includes a number of museums, libraries, and other places of interest. Visitors of all ages can participate in hands-on experiments, see live demonstrations, and learn more about the world of science at this museum.Michigan philanthropist Dexter Ferry founded the New Detroit Science Center in the 1970s. He believed that children in Detroit deserved the same opportunities as children in other major cities, but there were no major science centers in the area. In 1970, he opened a small center in an old car dealership building, and construction began on an official center in 1976. They shut down for nearly two years for major renovations, and since reopening in 2001, they've have over a million visitors.Today, one of the highlights of the New Detroit Science Center is the IMAX Dome, which was originally called an Omnimax. When it was constructed in 1976, it was only the second of its kind to ever be built n the United States. The dome is over 67 feet in diameter, and films on this screen have a unique 3-dimensional effect.The New Detroit Science Center has over 110,00 square feet of exhibits, labs, and other learning opportunities.

This three-story-high dome uses digital technology to allow the museum's experts to move the star field as you'd see in nature, rather than providing guests with just a traditional fixed view of the sky. They also provide show kits for some of their productions, which include slides, soundtracks, education materials, and other items to help children continue learning at home or in the classroom.The New Detroit Science Center is open seven days a week, with weekday hours from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM and weekend hours from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

Detroit,"Old St. Mary's Church - Detroit, Michigan - one of the oldest churches in Detroit","Nestled in the shadow of the towering skyscrapers of downtown Detroit, Old St. Mary's Catholic Church provides a peaceful retreat for both worshippers and tourists alike. The parish from which the church takes its name is the third oldest in Detroit and was founded in 1834 by Catholic immigrants from Neustadt, Germany. Its full name is St. Mary Roman Catholic Church, although most residents today simply refer to it as Old St. Mary's.In 1840, the founder of the parish, Father Martin Kundig was authorized to begin fund raising for a new church; and in 1841, a plot of land that was to be the site of the church was purchased for just one dollar. The cornerstone was laid the following year and the church's construction was overseen by Father Otto Skolla, replacing Father Kundig who had unfortunately suffered a nervous breakdown.From the beginning, construction of St. Mary's was a team effort. Many of the almost 100,000 bricks used were carried to the construction site by women of the parish; a local resident Antoine Beaubien donated the tower's four bells. Even the children of St. Mary's parish weren't forgotten - balconies were installed in several parts of the church, in order to seat the local children.In 1884, construction began on a new church to replace the older structure, under the supervision of Father Appolinaris Hattler. The new building was designed in the Roman style, although the design also contains elements of Venetian Renaissance and Pisan Romanesque. At the time of its construction, the steeple on Old St. Mary's was visible from miles around; today, despite the proliferation of taller buildings, it is still a major landmark in the city.The interior of the church is just as beautiful as the exterior. Much of the inside has been decorated in different shades of blue, creating a calm and relaxing atmosphere. One of the highlights is the beautiful 90 feet high ceiling, with its elaborate frescoes and bright colors of blue and orange. The beautiful granite columns were originally intended to be used in the state capitol building. The church's Stations of the Cross date from 1907 and are all carved from wood.Old St. Mary's prides itself on not only the quality of its music, but on its excellent acoustics and throughout its history has gained a well-deserved reputation for choral singing. One of the highlights of the Christmas and Easter seasons is the chance to enjoy the choir performing orchestral masses. The church's present organ dates from 1928 and is sister organ to the one in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.Old St. Mary's Church is conveniently located a short distance east of downtown Detroit and is just off I-375 in the area of Detroit known as Greektown. As the name suggests, this part of the city was settled during the 18th and 19th centuries by Greek immigrants and it's a good chance to sample some traditional Greek food before or after a visit to the church."
Detroit,"The Detroit Symphony Orchestra - Detroit, Michigan - fourth oldest symphony orchestra in the country","The Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) is the fourth oldest in the United States, and for most of its almost 100 years, has been one of the most respected orchestras in the country. In addition to its regular program of concerts that are listened to by an estimated 450,000 people every year, since 1926 the orchestra has also hosted a popular series of free educational concerts for children.The DSO had modest beginnings. In 1914, a small group of Detroit society women each contributed $100, hired a young church organist named Weston Gales to be the first musical director; and the Detroit Symphony was born. The orchestra's first performance was given at the Old Opera House in Detroit, although it soon became clear that a more permanent home would be needed.The orchestra enjoyed a major boost when in 1918, the well known Russian pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch accepted the post of music director - only on condition that a brand new and permanent venue be constructed. Orchestra Hall was designed by local architect C. Howard Crane, who was also responsible for designing several other Detroit theaters, and was completed in 1919 in just a few months. In 1922 it was the venue for the world's first radio broadcast of a concert symphony.During the 1930s, the DSO suffered two major misfortunes. Gabrilowitsch died in 1936, and the Great Depression resulted in serious financial problems and the orchestra having to move to various different venues. In 1989, the DSO finally returned to Orchestra Hall, following extensive renovations. Neeme Jarvi became musical director during this time period, remaining at the helm until 2005. In 2003, further renovations helped to make Orchestral Hall one of the top venues in the city and in the entire Midwest, and an education wing and a recital hall were also added. In 2007, the DSO announced that Leonard Slatkin would become the DSO's 12th music director. Slatkin is the current director.The DSO has enjoyed many successes over the years; it has released recordings on many famous labels, including Victor, Decca and RCA; and also provided the backing strings on many big Motown hits during the 1950s and 60s. The DSO also released the first CD to win the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque, with its recording of Stravinsky's The Rites of Spring. The Detroit Symphony Youth Orchestra was established as part of a training program in conjunction with the DSO, and today this is one of the most prestigious programs for children living in the Detroit area.Today, the DSO still enjoys success in its permanent home in Orchestra Hall, a grand building which is located on Woodward Avenue in Midtown Detroit and accessible by public transportation. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and is generally considered to be one of the most acoustically perfect venues anywhere in the world. Guided tours of the building and the behind the scenes production are available, and the DSO also encourages volunteers, both individual and corporate, to support their music."
Detroit,"The Fox Theater Building - Detroit, Michigan - top theatre venue in Detroit","Detroit's Fox Theater is considered one of the premier entertainment venues in the Midwest. Over the years, the theater has played host to such famous names as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison and Mariah Carey. It is also Detroit's top venue for Broadway shows and is the second largest theater in the country, after New York's Radio City Music Hall.The theater was constructed in 1928; one of several built by the film pioneer William Fox and designed by local architect C. Howard Crane. The building was designed with a beautiful and lavish interior featuring motifs from Persia, India and China, as well as a six story high grand lobby and a huge 13 foot diameter chandelier. The Asian theme is used on the building's exterior as well; the fazade is illuminated at night and can be seen from several blocks away.Much of the original decoration can still be seen today and behind the scene tours are available at the theater for groups of 15 or more. Another way to experience the grandeur of the building's interior is to be invited to one of the special events or conventions that are regularly held here. The Fox Theater can accommodate almost 4,000 guests at a time, including 500 in the huge lobby alone.Since its opening day, the Fox Theater was Detroit's major movie venue for many decades, managing to remain open into the 1970s when other local theaters were closing. In 1988 the theater was purchased by local entrepreneur Mike Ilich, who undertook a huge restoration program, costing an estimated $12 million. His efforts helped revitalize the surrounding area, which is sometimes known as Foxtown.The theater is owned by Olympia Entertainment, which itself is owned by Mike Ilitch. Olympia also owns several other of Detroit's well known entertainment venues, such as City Theater, the Masonic Temple Theater and the Joe Louis Arena. Ilitch Holdings has its headquarters in the Fox Theater office building and has been largely responsible for renovating many buildings in downtown Detroit.Since it became a venue for live productions in the 1980s, the Fox Theater has put on an ever changing program of diverse shows. In addition to featuring many of the biggest names in the entertainment world, it has also hosted the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame, the cast of Sesame Street., and shown a selection of plays and movies. One of its most popular and successful ventures was the Radio City Christmas Spectacular which ran from 1997 until 2005.Apart from the quality and range of its productions, the Fox Theater has several other distinctions. By using Fox's patented movietone sound system, it was the world's first movie theater to be constructed with equipment built in to enable it to show sound movies. Today, it is one of the most profitable theaters of its size in the country; it was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1989."
Detroit,"The Majestic Theatre - Detroit, Michigan - theatre, bowling ally, and tourist location in Detroit","Detroit's Majestic Theatre is one of several in the city designed during the early 20th century by the well-known and prolific local architect C. Howard Crane. The theater was opened in 1920 and could seat almost 1,700 people; at the time it was the world's largest purpose built movie theater; today it is probably best known for its varied program of live music, including rock, jazz and blues.However, the Majestic is much more than just a great place to hear live music; it also has the distinction of being home to one of the country's oldest operating bowling alleys, the Garden Bowl. The 16 bowling lanes glow in the dark and bowlers also enjoy music from an accompanying disc jockey. The bowling alley was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.The building's Majestic Cafy has long been a favorite place to meet in Detroit, even for those not attending a concert in the building. The cafy offers a selection of American and Mediterranean dishes, served in a dining room featuring exposed brickwork and wooden floors, as well as a good view overlooking the busy street below. The cafy also shows a constantly changing display of paintings by local artists.The theatre's fazade was designed in an elaborate Italian style, although this was later changed to an Art Deco theme, when the street was widened. It also featured a couple of innovative features for the time: a state of the art lighting system that could be turned up and down and an air-conditioning system that kept the theater cool by using huge fans to blow air on to blocks of ice stored in the basement.Like several other Detroit theatres, the Majestic has had to change with the times in order to survive and has had several other uses over the years, depending partly on the economic situation at the time. Throughout its almost 100 years of existence, it has been a church, a photographic studio and a shop selling trophies, as well as a movie theatre specializing in third run films.The Majestic is perhaps best known for its two live music venues, the Magic Stick and the Majestic Theater. Rolling Stone magazine declared that the Magic Stick was the best venue for live music in Detroit. Several local bands have got their start performing at one of the two venues; they have also hosted better-known groups such as Jimmy Cliff, Los Lobos, and Burning Spear. In addition to its program of live music, the Majestic Theater is also available for banquets and can provide outside catering to parties of all sizes.The building, located on what is often described as Detroit's main street, Woodward Avenue in the heart of the city's Cultural District, also boasts a pizza restaurant and several bars. It has become one of the city's most popular meeting places, as well as one of the best venues for live music in the Midwest and a popular choice for private parties and other events."
Detroit,"The Detroit Institute of Arts - Detroit, MI - art museum and collection","The Detroit Institute of Arts, or DIA was founded in 1885 and christened a ""temple of art.'' It was originally called the Detroit Museum of Art, with the name being changed in 1919 when the collection was given to the City of Detroit. Over the years, a number of expansion renovations took place, including a major build that lasted from 1999 to 2007. Today, the museum is home to more than 100 galleries covering over 670,000 square feet. This is one of the largest art collections in the United States, and their overall mission, according to their website, is to help every guest ""find personal meaning in art.''The DIA is known for its diversity in art. They have a number of exhibits ranging from prehistoric and ancient art to modern work. This museum was the first public collection in the United States to ever own and display a Van Gogh painting when the institute acquired the artist's Self Portrait in 1922. Many years later, in 2000, the museum put together Van Gogh: Face to Face along with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Some of these pieces can still be seen at the DIA today in celebration of this artist's work.There are a number of permanent displays at the DIA, as well as temporary displays that are changed every few months or years. The permanent collections include artwork from Africa, Oceania, the Indigenous Americans, the United States, Europe, Asia and the Islamic World. They also have specific collections that celebrate prints, drawings, and photographs. While at the DIA, visitors may also want to visit their performing arts department, the General Motors Center for Africa American Art, and The James Pearson Duffy Department of Contemporary Art. In addition, the museum's director has hand-picked a series of 12 works, called the ""Director's Dozen''In order to help preserve all of the artwork owned by the DIA, the museum has its own Conservation Department, complete with a state-of-the-art facility. Art history experts and scientists work side-by-side in this department to analyze artwork for information about its age and creation, which helps teach the museum how to best store the pieces.The DIA provides a number of educational options to visitors. They have classes for youth and adults interested in creating art, school programs for child of all ages, downloadable lesson plans for teachers, monthly artist talks, and guest lecturers throughout the year.Tourists can visit the DIA on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, on Fridays from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Columbus,"The Arena District Neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio Offers the Best of Urban Life","The Arena District Neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio is a mixed-use neighborhood of housing, retail establishments, offices, and entertainment.

The building of the arena district was part of a joint partnership between the city of Columbus and the Nationwide Realty Investors Group.

More office space and retail areas are also planned as is a large parking structure to accommodate the growing crowds that frequent the neighborhood.

Currently, the area enjoys the highest rates in the city for office and retail space.For those who wish to live in the area, apartments are available for rent or condos may be purchased at one of two developments within the Arena District Neighborhood.

Columbus,"German Village in Columbus, Ohio is a Thriving, Historic Community","A downtown Columbus, Ohio neighborhood that is known as one of the premiere historic districts in the country, German Village is a lovingly restored community, the largest privately funded historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Comprised of 233 acres, if functions not only as a home for many and a vibrant shopping and dining area, but also as a sort of living history museum.German Village is located on a tract of land that was first appropriated to Canadians who had assisted the U.S. in the causes of the American Revolution. The first owner of the land was Nova Scotia native John McGowan, who both lived on the land and sold parcels to many newly-arriving German immigrants, thus the neighborhood's eventual moniker. These immigrants began arriving in 1930, mostly from the southern portion of Germany. The Germans built homes and businesses and established churches in this portion of the city. They also formed many cultural and social organizations and began assuming political offices.Though most German-Americans served in World War I, much animosity towards those who settled in this neighborhood occurred during this time and into World War II. Street names were changed and German books and newspapers were burned. The Great Depression also took its toll on the neighborhood and decline was evident by the 1950s. However, an interested German-American purchased a home there in 1959 and started a movement to restore the German Village area. Restoration of homes and stores began and by the 1980s, the area was proclaimed one of the best urban restorations in the country.Today, visitors to German Village are treated to a look at beautifully restored structures that maintain the architectural integrity of the neighborhood's first buildings. In all, about 1,600 buildings have been restored since 1960 and lovely parks, walkways, and seating areas have been added. Visitors can enjoy a stroll through history as they walk through this thriving community that is now considered one of the city's most coveted places to live.In addition to stores, restaurants, and other commercial establishments, German Village is home to two attractive parks. Schiller Park includes beautiful gardens, notable sculpture, and a newly-renovated recreation center. Frank Fetch Park, named for the gentleman who began the renaissance in the Village, is developed along the lines of a 19th century Bier Garten and includes attractive landscaping, brick walkways, gas lamps, picnic tables, and plenty of open space for festivals and exhibits.The people who live in German Village along with local merchants sponsor several special events each year, but two are particularly notable.

In June of each year, the Haus und Garten (House and Garden) Tour features the opportunity to tour a number of the neighborhood's unique homes.

Designed for all ages to enjoy but most appealing to children, COSI is one of Columbus' most popular attractions, especially among school-aged youth.The idea for a science and industry museum in Columbus was proposed in 1958 by account executive Sandy Hallock II, and a few years later, the city's Memorial Hall began to be renovated in order to accommodate the museum. COSI opened to the public on Easter Sunday 1964 with more than 5,000 guests arriving on opening day.

Columbus,"Short North Arts District in Columbus, Ohio is a Cultural Mecca","The Short North Arts District of Columbus, Ohio is an arts-oriented area located just north of downtown, centered on the main section of North High Street and stretching to just south of the University of Ohio campus. Though the area is generally known as a gay-oriented neighborhood, merchants in the area cater to people of all sexual orientations.In the early 1900s, the North High Street area was bustling with activity and was the location of many of the city's best merchants. However, North High Street was later replaced with Interstate 670 and the strip became a location for seedy commercial establishments and, eventually, slum housing. Those who had resided in the area for many years moved to the now trendy suburbs and left the area open to violence and drug dealing. Police, who were called to the area frequently, began to refer to the region between downtown and the University of Ohio as Short North and the moniker stuck, referring to the fact that the region was ""just short'' of the north end business district of Columbus.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, urban dwellers looking for inexpensive housing options close to the downtown area began to purchase dilapidated homes in the Short North district and painstakingly restored them to their original state or better. Some buildings became offices and others were eventually made into shops, restaurants, or night spots. In 2002, the city jumped on the urban renewal bandwagon and installed 17 lighted metal arches across High Street, reminiscent of ones that were there in the early 1900s when Columbus was know as the Arch City.In the 21st century, the Short North district has become best known as an arts mecca. Nearly all the buildings have been restored, though some have been demolished to make way for parking lots. There are still plenty of residential opportunities there, including not only old restored rowhomes but also newer condominiums and apartments. Many of the older buildings in the neighborhood now sport colorful murals, painted on their sides, indicative of the large number of artists that live and work in the Short North Arts District today.Weekends in the Short North Arts District are very busy as visitors arrive from all around the city and beyond to shop in the neighborhood's many galleries and unique shops. Each Saturday, the district sponsors what has become known as a Gallery Hop.

Other shops and restaurants offer a variety of specials to coincide with Gallery Hop dates as well.Other special events are frequent in the Short North Arts District. They include the annual Doo Dah Parade, a parody on the typical all-American Fourth of July parade, featuring bands of unusual characters and floats with crazy and sometimes questionable themes.The Short North Arts District is easy to reach from the University of Ohio and from the Columbus Convention Center and Nationwide Arena. Several city bus routes also make a stop at the Short North neighborhood."

Columbus,"Victorian Village Neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio is Charming","Located northwest of downtown Columbus, Ohio, the Victorian Village Neighborhood is a long-established region of the city that had its start in the early 19th century. Officially bounded by Goodale Avenue on the south, N.High Street on the east, W.Fifth Avenue on the north, and Harrison and Neil Avenues on the west, the area features a fine collection of Victorian-style homes, thus its name. Along with neighboring Short North, it has gained a reputation as a gay-friendly area, but people of all persuasions live and work in this bucolic neighborhood.Many of the homes in the Victorian Village Neighborhood were constructed as long ago as the early 19th century when the street car first extended into the region along Neil Street, still the village's main thoroughfare. Much of the area's early population were wealthy businessmen and their families who built large, opulent homes near public transportation but somewhat removed from the then city center. There were also several large farms in the area that were later subdivided and turned into parks or sold to developers.Like many portions of the city of Columbus, urban blight came to this neighborhood in the post World War II years when suburbs began to spring up and people left the city for the quieter areas that surrounded it. Victorian Village was one of those areas that became run down and crime ridden by the late 50s. In the 1960s and 1970s, revitalization of the neighborhood began when the city declared the area an official historic district. Low interest loans were offered for urban renewal projects and many artists and others looking for affordable housing took advantage of these, purchasing homes of all sizes and renovating them. The result, 40 years later, is one of the city's loveliest districts, complete with many intact Victorian homes, thanks to the 1974-formed Victorian Village Architectural Review Commission, which sees to it that the treasures here maintain their architectural integrity.A stroll around the Victorian Village Neighborhood will allow visitors to view a number of different styles of Victorian homes, including Italianate, Queen Anne, Second Empire, Carpenter-Stick, and Four Square. Other architectural styles are evident as well, such as Tudor, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, and Romanesque. The largest homes can be seen around pretty Goodale Park while the smaller domiciles are on the side streets.Each September, the Victorian Village Neighborhood sponsors an annual Victorian Village Tour of Homes and Gardens, providing a prime opportunity to view these homes on the inside. This tradition began in 1975 and is still one of the highlights of the year for architectural history buffs who live in Columbus. Ten homes are showcased each year, and for a small fee, guests can visit each one and receive a tour by the homeowner. The committee in charge always takes care to choose a variety of homes for the event, including new construction. Churches are often included as well. A preview tour and reception are also offered at an additional cost."
Columbus,"Whetstone Park in Columbus, Ohio a Picturesque Place to Relax","Located in the northeast section of the city of Columbus, Whetstone Park is a 136 acre green area featuring space for a variety of activities.

Several organized social or athletic clubs meet at the center on a weekly or monthly basis.Whetstone Park's ""Park of Roses'' area is a popular wedding site. There are three locations within the site that can be used for ceremonies. The Wedding Pavilion, which is a small white gazebo, is especially attractive for small ceremonies. The Brick Wedding Pavilion provides a more rustic look and can include the use of chairs or bleachers. The Wedding Mall, which can accommodate 100 - 150 chairs, is more suitable for larger affairs. A limited number of chairs are provided with the rental fee, which includes 2-hour use of the space as well as the use of a changing area. Ample parking is available for large events.Columbus' Whetstone Park is also park of the Whetstone Prairie Project. Sponsored by the Recreation and Parks Department and a non-profit group known as Columbus Wild Ones, this project strives to turn 5.1 acres of lowland along theOlentangy River into native Ohio prairie, complete with vernal pools and a woodland buffer. It will eventually be used as a demonstration and education site. Volunteers are encouraged to join the Wild Ones organization and assist in the conversion of this area."
Columbus,"Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden in Columbus, Ohio a Beautiful Sight to Behold","Located two miles east of downtown Columbus, Ohio, the Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden is a horticultural and educational attraction that is a popular tourist spot for those visiting the greater Columbus area.This 88-acre facility is home to hundreds of plant and tree species, arranged in attractive outdoor gardens or located within the facility's expansive conservatory building, the architectural centerpiece of the attraction. It is the mission of Franklin Park Conservatory to ""promote environmental appreciation and ecological awareness for everyone. Our unique botanical collections provide lifelong learning opportunities in a friendly and accessible setting, which preserves tradition and provides a refuge for the soul.''Sitting on the land that was once the site of the Ohio State Fair, the Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden was officially established in 1895. It was built around a grand Victorian-style conservatory/greenhouse, which was modeled after the Glass House from the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and Columbian Exposition. That glass structure, now the Palm House, would eventually be listed in 1974 on the National Register of Historic Places.For the first few decades, the conservatory housed animals as well as plants, but they were moved when the local zoo opened in 1929. Through the 20th century, Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden enjoyed moderate success but was thrust into the limelight in 1992 when it hosted AmeriFlora, an international exhibition. On the heels of this event, the directors decided to add a seasonal butterfly exhibition in 1994 and, in 2003, hosted an exhibit of works by famed glass artist Dale Chihuly and then purchased the entire exhibit, making this conservatory the only one in the world to have a collection of Chihuly works. The Chihuly collection attracts hundreds of visitors each year.Guests still come mainly to view the flowers, plants, and trees, however. The Entry Plaza is home to a variety of colorful species that vary with the season, including a holiday showcase and winter interest garden in the colder months. The Bride's Garden, added in August 2008, uses white as a unifying color and includes fountains, detailed stonework, winding paths, and trees with heart-shaped flowers. The Cascades Garden includes beautiful waterfalls, native perennials, and a variety of small wildlife, meant to be an oasis in the middle of the busy city.Inside the Palm House, visitors will find 43 species of palms from throughout the world, many that are endangered. The North Conservatory consists of three different biomes. The Himalayan Mountain Biome includes species found in a temperate mountain climate of about 9,000 feet above sea level; the Tropical Rainforest Biome is indicative of eco-systems located along the equator in Asia, Africa, and South America; and the Desert Biome includes plants that can survive in sparse rainfall. The South Conservatory houses the Pacific Island Biome, which represents the eco-system of a volcanically-formed island.Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden also hosts about a half-dozen special exhibitions each year and sponsors a number of educational programs for the general public. Classes for adults include garden walks, bonsai growing, art classes, lectures, and gardening programs. Family programs feature hands-on activities for ages 5 and up. Summer week-long camps are also offered for children up to grade 8.The Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden is open year round from Tuesday through Sunday and on particular Monday holidays. Guided and cell phone tours are available and there is a caf, and gift shop on the premises."
Columbus,"Kelton House Museum and Gardens in Columbus, Ohio Preserves Local History","Located in Columbus, Ohio's Discovery District, the mission of the Kelton House Museum and Gardens is to promote an understanding of daily life, customs, and decorative arts in 19th century Columbus and to educate visitors about the Underground Railroad.The home, built in 1852, was once the property of Fernando Cortez Kelton, a wealthy dry goods wholesaler and prominent Columbus citizen, and his wife, Sophia. The Keltons were staunch abolitionists who were eager to open their home to escaped slaves as a stop of the so-called Underground Railroad. The Keltons raised at least one slave as a member of their own family and were dedicated to the cause of freedom for slaves throughout their lifetime. It is said that Mr. Kelton was so well-known for his support of the abolition of slavery that he was asked to be a pall bearer for President Lincoln when his casket came through Columbus.The home remained in the Kelton family until 1975 when the last remaining Kelton granddaughter, Grace Bird Kelton, passed away. Ownership of the house and gardens was then passed on to the Junior League of Columbus, which turned it into a museum, restoring to represent a time period between 1850 and 1900. Grace Kelton had left it to the Junior League with stipulations that it be preserved and used for educational purposes.Currently, Kelton House is the only house museum in the city of Columbus. Inside, it's full of beautiful Victoriana - furnishings, silver, artwork, and other items from the Victorian period. An estimated 80% to 90% of the furniture in the home once belonged to the Kelton family. Daily tours are led by trained volunteer docents who can educate visitors in the particulars of life and the decorative arts during the Victorian era.Kelton House Garden is also a joy to explore. Restored to Grace Kelton's design, the garden reflects both Ms. Kelton's personal tastes and Victorian influences in gardening such as hedges, statuary, latticework, and perennial borders. Crab apple trees line the walkway and the garden is abloom with wild flowers, azaleas, rhododendron, and other popular flowering plants. Many of the sculptural pieces in the garden came from Kelton family trips to Europe and Asia.Special ""experiential'' tours are also available at Kelton House Museum and Gardens. Costumed actors portray Sophia Kelton and the slaves she rescued. Sophia will share information about the Kelton's life as abolitionists and how they became involved with the Underground Railroad. Guests can also enjoy ""Tea with Sophia,'' which includes an afternoon guided tour and refreshments.Kelton House Museum and Gardens is also available for rent for special occasions. The garden is an ideal place for an outdoor wedding ceremony and reception and the museum can accommodate 100 to 150 guests for a cocktail reception or sit-down dinner.The museum and gardens is open every Sunday afternoon for tours or on other days by special request."

Fort Worth,"Flatiron Building - Fort Worth, TX - Seven-Story Wedge Building","In 1883, Marshall R. Sanguinet moved to Fort Worth. He formed an architectural company, Sanguinet and Staats, with Carl G. Staats in 1903. This company then proceeded to build many of the buildings in the Fort Worth area including churches, schools, the Waggoner Building, and the Flatiron Building. The Flatiron Building in Fort Worth was commissioned by Dr. Bacon Saunders, who had seen the 22-story NYC Flatiron Building. Saunders, a prominent surgeon, had moved to Fort Worth in 1893 and desired to establish his medical practice atop a building like the one he had seen in Manhattan. The Fort Worth Flatiron Building was completed in 1907.The Flatiron Building is located at 1000 Houston Street, on the corner of Houston Street and West 9th Street. This location is at the northwest corner of the Fort Worth Convention Center and just north of Fort Worth City Hall. It is roughly 2,750 square feet. At the time that it was built, the Flatiron Building was one of Fort Worth's first buildings to have a steel frame. It was also the tallest building in north Texas at the time that it was built.The design of the Fort Worth Flatiron Building was heavily influenced by what is known as the Chicago School of Architecture. This style was developed by a number of architects active in Chicago during the 1880s through the early 1900s. It is notable for its steel-frame structure and fire-resistant materials. Architectural enthusiasts will be able to note the influences of the famous Chicago School architect, Louis Sullivan. The original plans were for the building to be ten stories, but due to cost, this was reduced to the current seven stories. Saunders had commissioned the building for $70,000.Sullivan's concept of dividing a building into three parts, the base, shaft, and crown can be seen in the Flatiron Building's construction. The Flatiron Building has a two-story base and five-story shaft. Dr. Saunders' office and pharmacy were located on the top two floors. The exterior fazade of what was Saunders' offices is highlighted by numerous arches.Above the second floor exterior, a number of panther heads stand out from the fazade. This symbolism harkens back to Robert Cowart's 1875 comment about Fort Worth, which lead to the Fort Worth being nicknamed ""Panther City.'' The rather ornate cornice styling is often considered architecturally Neo-romantic.In 1969, the building was listed as a state historical item and two years later was included on the National Register of Historical Places. When built it was the tallest building in North Texas. The building remains the only flatiron-styled building in Texas, and is one of five on the National Register.Although the building can still be seen by visitors, the Flatiron Building is currently undergoing renovations that are anticipated to cost $4 million. The renovations call for a cafy to be added on the ground floor of the building. In addition, the renovations intend to convert part of the building into luxury loft apartments."
Fort Worth,"Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, Fort Worth, Texas","On May 21, 1941 Fort Worth Texas decided to create a children's museum based on science and history.

They have helped uncover several dinosaur fossils, which are on display at the museum. They also have five new specimens from the Fort Worth region. Cultural education is as important as the rest of the exhibits to the museum. They have pre historic displays regarding cultures from those early times up to the present. In fact displays of Pre-Columbian ceramic figures with roots to Central America are at the museum.Since the museum is about education, they have 20,000 items that have been duplicated for teaching purposes. Schools can borrow the 2,400 pieces collections for their students. These kits have cowboy gear, pioneer artifacts, and scientific specimens.During the year the Fort Worth museum provides a number of events to get the community more involved. School open houses, science and history day, design inspirations, mad scientist ball, and more occur throughout the year. Most of the events are annually held, but new ideas do come about as well.The construction which began in 2007 is adding more new exhibits. They created a whole new building for the new exhibits. Galleries at the museum include Cattle Raisers, Energy, Children's Museum, and Visible Collections. The Cattle Raisers gallery is all about teaching the history of cattle ranching in Texas and the Southwest. This gallery used to be a separate downtown museum. However, the new building has opened up space for it and to add more items. The Energy exhibit is also new with information regarding how to save energy, natural gas production, and even how energy has changed over time."

Fort Worth,"Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge - Fort Worth, TX - Preservation and Protection","The Forth Worth Nature Center and Refuge is located in Fort Worth, Texas. It is located at 9601 Fossil Ridge Road in Fort Worth, TX. Fort Worth is located in the north of Texas and is the seventeenth largest city in the USA. The center is located in the northern part of Fort Worth, off of Jacksonboro Highway, near Lake Worth. Lake Worth is a reservoir that was built in 1914.The mission statement of the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge states their desire to educate the community in the protection and preservation of natural areas, particularly those in North Central Texas.  The Refuge is over 3,600 acres in size and stretches between the Fort Worth (Grand) Prairie and the Western Cross Timbers. These two ecosystems form the emphasis of the Center's focus. The land itself is a combination of prairie and savannah. The West Fork of the Trinity River cuts through the Refuge. The West Fork is one of four forks of the Trinity River. The West Fork flows through the city of Fort Worth as well as Lake Worth.Savannahs, which have sparse tree cover, and prairies, which have no tree cover, make up the Refuge property. As such, the grassland ecosystem encompassed by the Refuge includes a variety of ecologically important grasses. These include: little bluestem (a perennial grass which is blue in the spring), Indian grass (the official state grass of SC and OK), and dropseed (which flowers in late summer). Post oak trees, which are native to Texas, is the most common tree on the Refuge. There are some samples which are over 300 years old on the property. Bur oaks, large trees which grow in the open, are also common to the area.There are paved roads which lead to over 20 miles of hiking trails. Most of the trails are between 2 and 3.5 miles in length. Prairie Trail is a 1.13 mile trail in open prairie that is connected to Oak Motte and Wild Plum Trails. Wild Plum is a shorter trail, about a half-mile, that wends its way through wild plum thickets. Oak Motte is over 2 miles long and meanders through clusters of oak trees.Along these trails, wildlife is prevalent. Bald eagles, turkeys, black vultures, and osprey are all common sites along the water. White-tailed deer and prairie dogs are also commonly spotted.The Nature Center and Refuge has a vast array of programs and features throughout the year. A detailed calendar of events is available on their website. Some events and programs include: Naturalist-led Nature Walks, Canoe Tours, and photography workshops. There are frequent workshops that involve visitors in projects, such as the building Kitchen Worm Bins or Bird Feeders. Seasonal-themed events also take place.Although city-owned, the Refuge has over a dozen volunteer opportunities.

Seattle,"Crescent Lake, Olympic National Park - Seattle, Washington - Large and Beautiful Lake with Name to Match its Shape","One of the most beautiful areas of the Olympic National Park is Lake Crescent. It is one of the national park system's most diverse national parks which contain snowcapped peaks, temperate rain forest, and windswept ocean coastal areas. The park is located along the Olympic Peninsula in the extreme northwest corner of Washington State and is surrounded by the Strait of Juan De Fuca on the north, the Pacific Ocean on the west, and the Puget Sound. Although it is only a short distance to Seattle across the Puget Sound, the park seems very remote as the population of Washington's Olympic peninsula is limited.The large lake lies in the extreme northern part of the park not far south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and is 600 feet deep in places. The lake was formed by the action of Pleistocene glacier. This curved, deep, freshwater lake is surrounded by high mountains, including 4,534-foot Storm King Mountain. At ten miles long and 624 feet deep, the highly scenic lake is attractive to swimmers as well as anglers hoping to land their share of its plentiful trout. Due to its consistency, recreation at the lake includes fishing. Before heading out on a fishing excursion, consultation with local area guides and resources prove beneficial.Aside from fishing, boating is especially good in Lake Crescent. Visitors can rent paddleboats, rowboats, and canoes at the Log Cabin Resort. Visitors can get to Lake Crescent from U.S. Route 101, 17 miles west of Port Angeles.The park itself is very large and contains 922,000 acres. The area include 60 glaciers, 13 rivers, 57 miles of coastline, over 600 miles of trails, the greatest remaining true wilderness forest in America, and the largest herd of Roosevelt elk in the United States. The park includes three separate and diverse ecosystems-subalpine forest and wildflower-rich meadows, temperate rain forests, and the Pacific coastline.The Olympic peninsula has a long history of human habitation and use, dating back some 12 thousand years to a time when human beings fed on animals such as mastodons. Some nine Indian tribes made use of the area for fishing, hunting, and gathering food. The area provided ample resources such as sea food, berries, roots, elk, and deer for food, and the bark of cedar trees for robes, mats, and baskets.European explorers first became aware of the area in 1774 on a voyage by Spanish navigator Juan Perez. In 1788 sea captain John Meares sighted the park, and named its highest mountain, Mt. Olympus. Although the Spanish established a settlement near Neah Bay in 1791, the rugged topography and dense vegetation made the park area itself somewhat impenetrable and the mountains were not crossed until the James Christie expedition in 1889. Mt. Olympus itself was first climbed in 1907. Rich in history and beauty, the Crescent Lake offers wilderness at its finest preservation."
Seattle,"Jimi Hendrix Grave, Seattle, Washington: His Birthplace and Final Resting Place","Jimi Hendrix had a tragically short life, but he changed the music industry with his innovative sounds and style. At the time of his death in London in 1970, he had released three albums, all of which did well on the charts in both the United States and England. He was only 28 years old.There has long been speculation about whether his death was an accidental drug overdose, suicide or something more sinister, but the official report lists his death as accidental.Even now, nearly 40 years after his death, Hendrix still has throngs of loyal fans. Each year, 14,000 of those fans make the journey to a suburb of Seattle, Washington to visit the grave and memorial site for Jimi Hendrix.Hendrix was born in Seattle on November 27, 1942. Very early in his life he showed an interest in music. His father, Al Hendrix, fed that interest by supplying him with whatever musical instruments he could afford. First it was an old ukulele with one string that he found. Next it was a second hand guitar and then, a few years later, an electric guitar .Hendrix was involved with a couple of bands before joining the U. S. Army. During his enlistment, he was a paratrooper, but had to be discharged due to an injury sustained during a jump .After leaving the military, he turned again to music. He performed as Jimmy James before releasing his first solo album using the name Jimi Hendrix. The album, titled ""Are You Experienced'', featured what would become some of his biggest hits. These include the songs ""Purple Haze'' and ""Foxy Lady'' .After his death, his father wanted his son to be buried near his birthplace so he secured what would become a Hendrix family plot in the Greenwood Memorial Park. The grave is located in Renton, Washington about 13 miles from Seattle.At first, it was a simple grave marker, but in 2002 a larger memorial was erected. The site includes a large dome that houses a life size image of Hendrix.  The memorial includes a total of 54 plots that will be the final resting of other members of the Hendrix family .The grave is a place for fans to visit and reflect of the short life and musical accomplishments of Jimi Hendrix."

The neighborhood is not exclusively gay by any means, and there are almost no establishments that aren't integrated with homosexual and heterosexual customers.Capitol Hill has been the center of Seattle's alternative community for decades. During the 1990's, Capitol Hill was one of the birthplaces of the country's grunge movement. Kurt Cobain and other famous grunge musicians frequented Capitol Hill establishments. Capitol Hill is still the center of Seattle's independent music community and welcomes alternative lifestyles from every genre.Popular retail districts within Capitol Hill include Broadway, the Pike/Pine corridor, and 15th Ave East. There are a variety of restaurants, bars, music venues, clubs, boutiques, and other shops in the neighborhood. Condominium and apartment buildings surround the areas and there are many grand old homes in ""mansion land"" to the north, near Volunteer Park. Capitol Hill residents are generally some of the most politically progressive in the country. Many of the 1999 WTO protests spilled from downtown into Capitol Hill.Besides the inevitable large Seattle-based chains like Starbucks,Seattle's Best Coffee (now owned by Starbucks), andTully's Coffee, Capitol Hill has been home to some of the city's most prominent locally owned coffeehouses.

The First Methodist Protestant Church of Seattle, listed on theNational Register of Historic Places, is now the headquarters of the Catalysis Corporation.

Seattle,"Seattle Center Monorail - Seattle, Washington - Convenient and Reasonably Priced Modern Train Travel in the City","The Seattle Monorail has been a Seattle icon since the 1962 World's Fair. Many people believe that the monorail is owned, managed and operated by the City of Seattle. However, unlike Metro, Sound Transit and the trolley, the monorail is a privately run business with independent leadership and staff. Not only is the monorail not government subsidized, but in fact, it brings in money for the city.Area businessman, Tom Albro, holds the concession with the City of Seattle to manage and operate the monorail. The Monorail provides area convenience and efficient travel throughout the region.Today, the trains carry approximately 1.5 million riders every year. The monorail has become an important fixture in Seattle for locals, who use the trains during major festivals and sporting events. Seattle Center Monorail is the nation's only fully self-sufficient public transit system.Travelers can park downtown and take the Monorail to Seattle Center during festivals and events throughout the year. Trains typically depart every ten minutes or less. The Macy's garage (3rd and Stewart) frequently offers reduced parking rates for monorail patrons during the summer's three major festivals:Folk life,Bite of Seattle, andBumbershoot, in addition to Sonics' home games.The Seattle Center Monorail system uses 62 pre-stressed concrete piers to support the two beams which the monorails ride upon. The trains can cover the 1 mile distance at a top speed of 50 miles per hour, making it the fastest full-sized monorail system in the country, even today.Riding on 64 rubber pneumatic tires, the monorail runs on 700 volts D.C. power obtained through contact rails on the inside of the beam. 16 load-carrying tires ride on top of the beam, and 48 guide tires grip the sides of the beam.The Seattle Center Monorail trains operate from 9am to 11pm seven days a week. The Monorail departs every 10 minutes from the station at Seattle Center, (across from the Space Needle) and from Westlake Center Mall, at Fifth and Pine Street. Each trip takes two minutes to cover the 1 mile route. Each train can carry up to 200 passengers per trip.

Seattle,"Original Starbucks - Seattle, Washington - The Birthplace of the Original Starbucks Coffee Shop","The original Starbucks was opened inPike Place Marketin Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacherJerryBaldwin , historyteacherZevSiegel, and writerhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_BowkerAlfredPeet (whom they knewpersonally) to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. From1971-1976, that first Starbucks was at 2000 Western Avenue; it then wasrelocated to 1912 Pike Place, where it remains to this day. During theirfirst year of operation, they purchased greencoffeebeans fromhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peet's_Coffee_%26_TeaEntrepreneurHowardSchultz joined the company in 1982 as Director of Marketing, andafter a trip toMilan,Italyadvised thatthe company should sell coffee andespressodrinks as well asbeans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into thebeverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. Tothem,coffeewassomething to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was money to bemade selling pre-made drinks; Schultz started theIl Giornalecoffee barchain in 1985.In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there).The location was at the corner of Virginia and Pike Place, where this first-ever Starbucks was in business until January of 1977, when it moved to its current ""original"" store one block south. The current store in the Market is actually the sixth one, since there were stores in University Village, Capitol Hill, Edmonds, and Bellevue, along with the original-original, before the present Market Starbucks opened. And the stores in those days were quite different than now. They sold only coffee beans (roasted at first at Peet's in Berkeley) and coffee makers, not cups of coffee (and certainly not lattes), though they would pour you a free cup in the first year.The interior of the first Starbucks offers a long and white high-ceilinged room with glass cabinets along one side. The area is open to visitors who enjoy sipping some Sumatra or are just catching a glimpse of history. The fazade of the store retains its crude lettering and appearance per the historic codes of the neighborhood. The actual coffeehouse is along a strip of retail shops across the many food stalls, produce sellers, fish markets, restaurants, and the shops inside Pike Place Market.If you are a Starbucks connoisseur, you will want to stop by the birthplace of an icon. Seattle offers an array of cultural and historical venues, but the original Starbucks coffee destination is worth a visit. The appearance is not much different than some of the older Starbucks cafes but does offer an interesting taste in history and a piece of Seattle you will never forget."

Museums, public art, theaters, sporting events and outdoor happenings abound.The University of Washington moved into the neighborhood two years after the area was annexed to Seattle, while much of the area was stillclear cutforest or stump farmland. The district of neighborhoods grew with the university to become a microcosm of urban American cities. Many of the retailers and eateries today cater to the vast fraternity row students from the University of Washington. Great venues are available to all locals and tourists alike, but be prepared to fight the crowds of students when frequenting them.The U-District StreetFair is the kick-off event for the festival season in the Seattle region.

Seattle,"Bank of America Tower - Seattle, Washington - Columbia Center Offers Amazing Observation Deck and Architecture","Seattle skyscraper fans frequently note this building as Seattle's most famous, to the general public it is somewhat less significant. Certainly the Smith Tower and Pike Place Market are more historically and culturally visible through postcards and tourist materials sent around the world. Still, the Columbia Center is worthy of a significant amount of praise.The architecture is based on the simple black glass block so popular in the 1970's and 1980's. But in this case, the simple form was made graceful and elegant through the use of three sweeping arcs of multiple elevations. The Columbia Center manages to break out of the monotony and stand out among the world's great towers. This would have been possible even if it had adhered to conventional design forms. Clocking in at a massive 997 feet, this is a building that demands attention.Still, its position in the skyline is unfortunate. In picture post cards it is frequently the tall kid in the back of the class on the right who doesn't get noticed as much as the one in the center like the Washington Mutual Tower. Although the tower is tall it doesn't receive the notoriety that the other skyscrapers do.It was the Federal Aviation Administration that first took the building down a notch, reducing its design height from 1,005 feet. Whether the eight foot reduction really makes a difference to pilots coming into SeaTac airport is a matter for speculation. The developers weren't going to lose any money on the deal by reducing the number of floors available for rent. They simply reduced the ceiling height on each floor by six inches. The fix is perhaps not the most elegant solution, but at least the most practical.The observation deck at the top of Columbia Center or Bank of America Tower offers a panoramic view from its 73rd floor. The view is not completely panoramic because the deck doesn't wrap around the building completely. It's best to call ahead as security concerns occasionally may close the observation deck. Admission rates are $5, $3 for seniors and students. The women's restroom on the 76th floor, with views of the Cascades, was named the second best restroom in the U.S. in 2005 by Cintas.There is a lot of discussion of the obscenity and obstruction of the skyscraper but the dispute has come to an end but in little or no agreement. Onlookers either believe the tower to add to the skyline or take away. The architecture remains unique and modern but can pose an eyesore if trying to photograph nearby design work."
Seattle,"Gas Works Park - Seattle, Washington - Industrial Archeology and Design in the form of a Park like Setting","Gas Works Park is on the site of an old gasification plant that once powered much of Seattle from 1907 to the mid 1950's. It was said that nothing would ever grow on this ground again due to the hydrocarbon contaminates, soot and petro chemical waste polluting the soil. The park has proved otherwise and now offers a great venue for Seattle residents to enjoy the outdoors.A massive soil cleaning effort was needed to create the park that now stands in its place. Portions of the original ""Gas Works"" remain, the largest remnant of the 1,400 such plants that existed in the US, and can be seen in the background. On the top of Gas Works hill is a giant 28 foot wide sundial created from concrete inlaid with cast bronze, shells, ceramics, art and other objects.This 20 acre point on Lake Union was cleared in 1906 to construct a plant to manufacture gas from coal - later converted to crude oil. Import of natural gas in the 1950's made the plant obsolete. The city acquired the site for a park in 1962. The park was opened to the public in 1975. The boiler house has been converted to a picnic shelter with tables, fire grills and an open area. The former exhauster-compressor building, now a children's play barn, features a maze of brightly painted machinery.Gas Works Park is a unique landmark for the City of Seattle. The original structures qualify as industrial archaeology and are the last remaining examples of a type of technology. These structures have been double served by Gas Works Park for not only have they been preserved but they have been integrated into an innovative, ground-breaking park design. The combination of a dramatic site and historic structures with the innovative park design has only increased the importance of Gas Works Park. The integrity of the original Gas Works is impressive. Although not all of the structures were saved, the character defining and prominent group of towers remains. The reuse of the pump house and boiler house has maintained building structure and much of the machinery. The site retains its original boundaries and lake frontage.Gas Works Park is the work of its designer, Richard Haag, a prominent Seattle landscape architect. Haag is the only person to twice receive the American Society of Landscape Architects Award for design excellence, one of the awards given for his design of Gas Works Park. Haag has received international acclaim for his design of Gas Works Park.Gas Works Park has a play area with a large play barn, and big hill popular for flying kites. Special park features include the sundial, and a beautiful view of Seattle. Burke-Gilman Trail runs past Gas Works parking lot and follows the Burlington-Northern Railroad 12.5 miles north to Kirkland Log Boom Park. There is a large parking lot 30 yards away with two handicapped parking spots.Gas Works Park has been a setting for films, such asSinglesand10 Things I Hate About You. It has been featured twice on the travel-based television reality showThe Amazing Race-once as the finish line forSeason 3and another time as the starting line for Season 10."

The Center is within easy walking distance of the city's best shops, sights, hotels and restaurants.In the early 1980s, a group of community leaders from the public and private sectors conceived the notion of building a convention center in Seattle to foster new economic development. In 1982, with support of the state Legislature, a public non-profit corporation was established to acquire land and to design, construct, promote and operate the Washington State Convention & Trade Center. A site adjacent to, and over Interstate 5 was selected and initial construction began in the fall of 1985, and continued for nearly three years. The Center's first scheduled event took place on June 18, 1988.The Convention Center, throughout its history, has exceeded the mandate of the Legislature to provide economic and civic benefits for the people of the state of Washington. These benefits have included a commitment to the building and renovation of affordable housing, historic preservation of significant structures and acquiring an extensive collection of public art.WSCTC offers the option of working with a single point of contact to plan the specifics of any event. An Event Coordinator will review the Meeting Planner Checklist as you assemble your event information. Together you will plan telecommunications and technical requirements, lighting, plumbing and more. And WSCTC offers superior food and beverage services, from light breakfast snacks to reception, full-service meals.The Convention Center operates two covered parking garages that adjoin each other and the Convention Center. The two parking garages can accommodate approximately 1,565 vehicles. Unlike most downtown parking garages located in the retail and theater district, Convention Center parking is located in close proximity to two I-5 exits and is accessible from the eastside of the freeway.The Convention Center recently installed a new parking system that has dramatically improved the speed of exiting the parking garages. The new central cashier and stand alone express payment machines give customer's the choice of friendly outstanding customer service from our cashiers or, the quick transaction speed of the stand alone express payment machines.Payment machines and cashier's accept major credit cards and cash.

ACT and the parking garages are connected, there is no need to go out in the weather or wait at street lights. Shoppers can also go from the Convention Center through a walkway that goes to 4th Avenue's Rainer Tower, without stopping for traffic lights. This route is lined with retail shops."
Seattle,"Smith Tower - Seattle, Washington - The Oldest Skyscraper in the City and Designated Landmark","The Smith Tower is located in Pioneer Square and noted as the oldest skyscraper in Seattle, Washington. Completed in 1914, the tower is named after its builder, firearm and typewriter magnateLyman Cornelius Smith. Containing 42 floors, it was the tallest office building west of the Mississippi River until theKansas City Power & Light Buildingwas built in 1931. It remained the tallest building on the West Coast until the Space Needleovertook it in 1962. The building is a designated landmark in the greater Seattle area.The Smith Tower is a great example ofneoclassical architecture. Its outer skin is made of granite on the first and second floors, and terra cotta on the rest. It has been washed only once since its construction, in 1976, because it remains remarkably clean without regular washing.The building is the last on the West Coast to have live elevator operators. TheOtis Elevator Companyprovided the elevators, which have uniquely designed brass surfaces. The doors are latticed, so a rider can see into each hallway and through the glass walls in front of each office.The Chinese Room is on the 35th floor of the tower, the same level as the observatory. The furniture and the hand carved ceiling were gifts from theEmpressofChina. They include the famous Wishing Chair. It is said that a single woman who sits in the chair will marry within a year. The legend came true for Smith's daughter, who married in the Chinese Room itself.After the restoration in the early nineties, workers removed a thousand-gallon water tank in the very top of the tower. This resulted in much new space, and what was formerly a small maintenance man's apartment became a three-story penthouse, the only residence in the building.The very top of the building is crowned by an eight-foot wide glass dome which is illuminated by blue light, except for the month of December, when it is changed to green. The 37th floor originally contained a caretaker's apartment. Above was a multi-story, 10,000-gallon, cast iron water tank. The water tank was disassembled by welders who cut it into pieces small enough to fit into the elevator. Then the entire space was remade into a penthouse apartment. It is the only residence in the building and contains a massive Dale Chihuly chandelier.The Smith Tower has survived three earthquakes of a magnitude of 6.0 or greater: 2001, 1965, and 1949. The ground under the Smith Tower was never part of the tidal mud flats that underlie much of Pioneer Square. Core samples down to 122 feet below 2nd Avenue reveal fallen trees, some as large as 3 feet in diameter, which have never been exposed to seawater.The Smith Tower is just eight blocks south of the Pike Place Market in the ""Ride Free"" zone. No fare is required if you board and exit a bus within the downtown area. Most buses heading south on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd avenues will stop at James Street or Yesler Way. The Tower is a short 7-minute walk from downtown.The building is currently owned by Walton Street Capital and managed by Wright Runstad & Company."

Interest in the sport by both jumpers and spectators grew rapidly, and in 1933 the Seattle Parks Department applied for a permit from the United States Forest Service to establish a ski hill at Snoqualmie Pass.Accessed seven days and six nights a week by the Central Express high speed quad, the commitment continues year-round with large dirt-work projects in the summer (to allow more features earlier in the season) and the addition of more and more jibs to the fleet (over 60 total this season).Central Park at Summit Central continues to lead the Greater North West with its changing, creative and flat-out-fun layouts.

Visitors are encouraged to keep an eye on their dog, but feel comfortable enough to let them loose to enjoy their freedom.The park was named after and developed by Harry W. Treat in 1907 as an area attraction at the end of the new electric car lines being built by realtors to induce townsfolk to take a Sunday outing out of town and through the woods to a picnic or swim location at a beach. The Carbine ended at Loyal Way with a steep twisting path down into the park and down to a small parking area on the east side of the railroad tracks, then by foot across the tracks to the beach. At that time the northern half of Meadow Point (named by the Coast Guard) was the site of a shipyard until 1913. To the south the beach curved in along the railroad seaway - all the way to Salmon Bay. The State owns the tidelands south of the park, with boat works and yards by the Bay.There is a remodeled Golden Gardens Bathhouse that offers a waterfront location to host special events, like weddings or receptions.

Seattle,"Ballard District - Seattle, Washington - Bringing the Heart of Scandinavia to the Northwest","Ballard is a vibrant neighborhood located in the northwest part of the city of Seattle, just north of Salmon Bay. Ballard is bounded to the north by Crown Hill, to the east by Phinney Ridge and Fremont, to the south by Lake Washington Ship Canal, and to the west by Puget Sound's Shilshole Bay. The neighborhood is notarized for its landmarks including Ballard Locks or Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, Golden Gardens Park, the Shilshole Bay Marina, and the Nordic Heritage Museum.Ballard is a must see for tourists and is full of locally owned boutique shops, pubs, restaurants, and waterfront parks. Each month the Ballard Chamber of Commerce sponsors the Second Saturday Artwalk, which brings in residents from all over the Seattle area as well as tourists.Ballard was first settled in 1853. In 1889 it was incorporated in Washington State and in 1907, Ballard was annexed to Seattle. Proud of its Scandinavian heritage, Ballard has many reminders of its past including the annualNorwegian Constitution Day Parade, the Nordic Heritage Museum, and the Bergen Place mural that was dedicated by the King & Queen of Norway in 1996. The Ballard Avenue Historic District reflects the patterns of industrial growth in Seattle, as well as the city's Scandinavian heritage.In the 1870s and 1880s, several distinct communities were formed in the Puget Sound area that centered on the area's rich timber resources. A group of Seattle real-estate developers purchased a large tract of land along Salmon Bay, and divided the property into commercial, residential and industrial lots. Industry was established in the new town named Ballard. J. Sinclair and Ballard's first mill was built in 1888. In the following year Michigan's prosperousStimsonCompany built its first mill in the region, which turned out to be fortunate timing, for the Great Seattle Fire that year created an immediate demand for supplies. By 1895, Ballard claimed to be the center of the world's largest shingle industry and, by 1904, was producing an incredible 3 million shingles per day. Many of the mill jobs were filled by Scandinavian immigrants, establishing an ethnic influence that remains today.The area's success spurred the construction of commercial buildings north of the shingle mills-two and three story Italianate brick banks, retail stores, saloons, and hotels-that form the core of the historic district today. Incorporated in 1890 with a population of 1,173, Ballard took just five years to grow into a bustling town of 10,000 that supported sizable foundry and fishing industries, in addition to the tremendous shingle industry. Ballard continues to be a unique Seattle neighborhood, retaining its late 19th-century flavor while adapting to changing times.Area transit and growth are issues that remain in the greater Seattle area, including Ballard. Sustainable Ballard, a non-profit organization has been established and continues explore challenges in the community regarding traffic reduction in the neighborhood. The Get Carbon Neutral transportation campaign is working toward Ballard becoming the first carbon neutral community in the nation."

Seattle,"Pioneer Square - Seattle, Washington - Historic District in the Heart of the City","Pioneer Square's historic district of Seattle, Washington offers numerous art galleries, bookstores, antique shops, casual and upscale restaurants, and nightclubs all within walking distance of most downtown Seattle hotels. The neighborhood's cobblestone streets and horse-drawn carriages are a reminder how life used to be a century ago.The area is located from East to West, between 2nd Ave and the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and from South to North, between Columbia St. and King St. Pioneer Square is between downtown proper to the North, and the sports stadiums and International District to the South. Although the name indicates otherwise, there is no square shape at Pioneer Square.Pioneer Square is the city's second oldest neighborhood. Many of the buildings in Pioneer Square date back to the 1890's but little of Seattle's early architecture survived the fire of 1889. The civic leaders of the day took advantage of the fire to raise the streets in Pioneer Square, solving a long standing drainage problem that the area once had.Visitors are able to catch a glimpse of old Seattle by taking the Underground Tour. The tour is a Seattle institution itself, and dates back to 1972. The area underwent a revival in the late 70's and early 80's when historic preservation became the city's priority. Pioneer Square was Seattle's first designated historic district and its vitality and survival remain prominent to this day.Other area highlights include Pioneer Place Park at the corner of James Street and 1st Avenue.Here there is the Seattle landmark of the iron pergola. Originally built to greet visitors to the 1909 World's Fair, the pergola welcomed the way and sheltered people waiting for the street car. The pergola was knocked over in 2001 by a wayward truck, but fully refurbished and restored in 2002. The park is also home to a Tlingit totem pole and behind the park is the Pioneer Building which is the headquarters of the Underground Tour.Occidental Park is situated among Pioneer Square along Occidental Street, between Washington and Main Streets.

Seattle,"Alki Beach - Seattle, Washington - Popular Beach Park Offering Everything Outdoors","West Seattle is an often overlooked area of Seattle that offers one of the few destination beaches on the Puget Sound. Alki Beach has a two and a half mile long pedestrian walkway and provides a popular hang-out for sun worshipers, beachcombers, and volleyball players. Most of the beaches on Puget Sound are covered in rocks and rough terrain, but on Alki Beach, visitors can walk in the sand, get some exercise, learn about Seattle's earliest settlers, and take in a great view of the city's skyline.Alki Beach can be easily reached by car via the West Seattle Bridge. From downtown Seattle, travelers follow the signs onto Interstate 5. Take the exit for West Seattle and once across the bridge, turn right onto Harbor Ave SW. This will lead around the tip of Duwamish Head, and onto Alki Point. Parking can be complicated on the weekends, but street parking not too far from the main strip along Alki Avenue SW is available. During the summer, leave the car behind and take Metro's water taxi. The taxi leaves from locations between piers 55 and 56, and for two dollars (each way) provides a twelve minute ride across the bay. At Sea Crest Park, the taxi's West Seattle terminus, guests will find Metro's Free DART shuttle which will take passengers to Alki Beach or West Seattle Junction.Seattle's first white settlers arrived on Alki Beach in 1851. They were helped through their first winter by the Duwamish people, led by Chief Seattle. The settlers named the area New York-Alki. Alki is a native word meaning ""by and by'', and the settlers chose the name to reflect their hope that the new settlement would grow to achieve the size and importance of New York City. After one winter camped on the beach, most of the party moved across Elliot Bay, to the less exposed shores of Seattle's current waterfront.Some of the area highlights include Alki Beach Park which provides 2.5 miles of sandy beach. This area has a great seawall for walking and people watching. The park runs from Duwamish head to Alki Point. The water is cold at the beach, but on a hot August day is well-populated and can't be beat. There is always something athletic going on in this neighborhood. Second only to Green Lake in Seattle, this area is known for athletics and outdoor fun.Also in the Alki Beach neighborhood is Salty's located at 1936 Harbor Ave SW. Salty's has become a northwest institution due to its spectacular view and romantic atmosphere. This is the only restaurant in the area with a view of the Seattle skyline from the SW side. Salty's is a favorite destination for couples and those celebrating special occasions. The restaurant specializes in seafood and on Saturday and Sunday mornings offers a great brunch to start the day.The Alki Point Lighthouse is one of eight lighthouses on the Puget Sound that is open to the public and can be enjoyed at Alki Beach. Built in 1913 and still maintained by the Coast Guard, the lighthouse has been fully automated since 1984.

Seattle,"Experience Music Project Museum - Seattle, Washington - Dedicated to the Exploration and Innovation of Popular Music","The museum is located in Seattle, right by the Space Needle andSeattleCenter. It is a unique architectural work designed by the famed Frank Gehry, and shares the same space with the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.Experience Music Project or EMP was founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and launched its grand opening in 2000.The museum struggled financially in its early years and as a result, Allen established theScience Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (SFM), which opened in 2004 in the south wing of the EMP building. When SFM opened, EMP and SFM were treated as separate museums, and visitors had the option of purchasing admission to one museum, or, at a higher cost, a combined admission to both. In 2007, after mounting criticism, both museums ended the separate admissions policy and began charging a single admission price for entrance to both wings.The exterior of the building is quite unique. The outside of the building consists of stainless steel and painted aluminum shingles, each individually cut and shaped. The stainless steel has three finishes: mirrored purple, lightly brushed silver, and bead-blasted gold. The red and blue sections are painted aluminum. Each finish takes on an exciting and unique shade when viewed from different angles around the building. The red will fade with time, altering the appearance of the building's exterior and reflecting how music is ever changing.Upon entering the Experience Music Project visitors will be welcomed by a large tower of guitars. There is also an area full of computers that provide pod casts about many subjects by experienced artists. Visitors also have the opportunity of trying out musical instruments and even orchestrating their own private jam sessions in soundproof booths.Experience Music Project showcases rare artifacts from popular music history and allows the visitor to experience music through interactive exhibitions like Sound Lab and On Stage. The museum contains mostlyrock memorabilia and technology-intensive multimedia displays.The Northwest Passage is dedicated to the history of Seattle music, includingJimi Hendrix,Heart, and thegrunge musicgenre.In 2002, EMP introduced a traveling collection exhibit entitledDisco: A Decade of Saturday Nights.

Seattle,"Nordic Heritage Museum - Seattle, Washington - The Heart of the Scandinavian Community","The Nordic Heritage Museum is located in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle and is considered by locals to be the heart of the Scandinavian community. The museum was founded in 1980 and is dedicated to the heritage of Seattle's Nordic immigrants such as the Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish Americans. The museum serves as a community-gathering place and shares Nordic culture by exhibiting art and objects, preserving antique collections, and providing educational and cultural experiences.The Nordic Heritage Museum is in a 1907 red brick school building that was originally Daniel Webster Elementary School. Located in Ballard, the heart of Seattle's Scandinavian community, Webster School educated generations of Scandinavian and other immigrant children who came to this region, including many of our own volunteers. Webster School closed in 1979 due to a sharp decline in student enrollment throughout Seattle. The Nordic Heritage Museum opened in this building in 1980.On the first floor of the museum is the Dream of America exhibition. It is the story of immigration told in an exhibit of life-like dioramas. Visitors can travel with family back to the nineteenth-century Scandinavian countryside to begin the journey to America, starting with the move to the city. The voyage continues as you board a ship to make the Atlantic crossing, and land at Ellis Island. The adventure goes on to experiences in New York, and the expansion to the Midwest, Great Plains, and Pacific Northwest, ending in Ballard. Here the growth and development of a typical small Northwest community is displayed, complete with a post office, church, drug store, blacksmith shop, and a family home.On the second floor of the facility is the Promise of the Northwest, which includes two galleries that focus on the logging and fishing industries that employed many immigrants who brought skills learned in the old country. These galleries show the contributions of the Nordic pioneers to the settlement of the Pacific Northwest. The Heritage Rooms display treasured and useful items the immigrants brought with them, including folk costumes, textiles, tools, and furniture. Temporary art, history, and heritage exhibits are housed in the three galleries at the west end of the hall.The third floor exhibitions illustrate the differences and the common bonds among the Scandinavian people. There is one gallery for each of the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Each gallery highlights that group's special achievements in the Pacific Northwest.The entrance is on 68th Street between 30th and 32nd Avenues North West and the museum is accessible by Metro bus #17, which stops on 32nd Avenue. There is plenty of free and handicapped parking for cars and tour buses in our parking lot in front of the museum.Museum hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. The museum is closed on all Mondays, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day.

Seattle,"Green Lake - Seattle, Washington - A Great Place to Fish, but Hold Off on Swimming","Green Lake is a freshwater lake that is located in north central Seattle within the Green Lake Park. The Green Lake neighborhood district to the north and the east surrounds this park. The Wallingford neighborhood lies to the south and the Phinney Ridge district is found to the west. Green Lake is one of Seattle's most beloved and well-known parks. Its expanse of water and green space in the center of a dense urban neighborhood draws thousands of people daily from all over the city. When the weather is sunny and warm - a rarity in Seattle - the park is flooded with locals.Geologists say the Vashon Glacial Ice Sheet, which also formed Puget Sound and other area lakes, formed Green Lake some 50,000 years ago. Dredging of Green Lake has produced volcanic ash from an eruption of Glacier Peak that occurred about 6,700 years ago.The actual lake was included in the Olmsted Brothers' comprehensive parks plan, and was given to the City by the State of Washington in 1905. Green Lake underwent a series of changes over the preceding fifteen years - it was dredged and filled until it shrunk by nearly 100 acres! The last fill deposited in Green Lake was from the excavation of Aurora Avenue.In more recent times, Green Lake suffered from stagnation and pollution problems, as well as algae blooms. Milfoil and swimmers itch (caused by parasites from waterfowl) are still a consideration for those who swim in the lake to this day and swimming is not recommended.The reconstructed 2.8-mile path around the lake provides a perfect recreational spot for runners, bikers, skaters and walkers. The path includes a 5 1/2 feet crushed granite trail closest to the lake for walkers and joggers, and a 13 1/2 foot asphalt path for wheeled users and walkers. Many other park visitors use the athletic fields or frequent the park for boating, picnics and swimming.The park serves as a natural preserve for hundreds of species of trees and plants, as well as numerous birds and waterfowl. As a beacon for wildlife, Green Lake attracts various species of ducks, cormorants, loons, geese, turtles, rats, squirrels, raccoons, bats, eagles, and herons to name a few. There is an artificial island in the lake that was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1936. The island was constructed as a wildlife sanctuary and later housed a family of swan that was given to the city by Vancouver, British Columbia.Many species of fish also call Green Lake home. Rainbow trout are stocked for recreational fishing and there is a large population of common carp are present, and can be seen spawning in the shallows in spring. Tiger Musky fish were once stocked to control the carp population. The lake also contains largemouth bass, yellow perch, bluegill, yellow bullhead, channel catfish, and small populations of many different unexpected species. Green Lake is a popular fishing destination for outdoor enthusiasts from all over the state."

Seattle,"Hiram M. Chittenden Locks - Seattle, Washington - Providing Links for Boats and Salmon between Saltwater and Freshwater","The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks are a complex of locks that provide a link for boats between the saltwater of the Puget Sound and the fresh water of the Ship Canal connecting to Lake Union and Lake Washington. To the area locals, they are commonly known as the Ballard Locks. The Locks, link salty Puget Sound with the fresh waters of Salmon Bay, Lake Union, Portage Bay and Lake Washington.The Locks serve three significant purposes. First of all, to move boats from the water level of the lakes to the water level of Puget Sound, and vice versa. Then, to prevent the mixing of seawater from the Sound with the fresh water of the lakes (also known as saltwater intrusion). Finally, to maintain the fresh water level of Lake Washington and Lake Union at approximately twenty feet above sea level.The complex includes two locks, a small (30 x 150 ft, 8.5 x 45.7 meters) and a large (80 x 825, 24.4 x 251.5 meters). The complex also includes a (235-foot, 71.6 meters) spillway with six (32 x 12-foot) gates to assist in water-level control. A fish ladder is created in the locks for the migration of fish, primarily salmon. The nearby grounds feature a visitor's center and the Carl S. English, Jr. Botanical Gardens.Both tourists and locals enjoy watching the parade of sailboats, motorboats, tugs, barges and yachts passing through the Locks. Visitors travel from all over the state to pass a sunny day watching boats of all shapes and sizes arrive into the locks. Upon arrival the water level is adjusted to allow their safe passage to the lake or Sound.The fish ladder was built to allow salmon to pass between fresh and salt water. Glass panels make it possible to view the fish as they navigate their way through the ladder, adjusting to different levels of salt each step of the way. Occasionally, a clever sea lion will hang out, waiting for his next meal. Although the viewing area is open year-round, the ""peak"" viewing time is during spawning season, from about the beginning of July through mid-August. The fish approaching the ladder smell the attraction water, recognizing the scent of Lake Washington and its tributaries. The salmon enter the ladder, and either jump over each of the 21 weirs or swim though tunnel-like openings. They exit the ladder into the fresh water of Salmon Bay. They continue following the waterway to the lake, river, or stream where they were born. Once there, the females lay eggs, which the males fertilize. Most salmon die shortly after spawning.There is also a public art work, commissioned by the Seattle Arts Commission that provides literary interpretation of the experience through recordings of Seattle poet Judith Roche's ""Salmon Suite,"" a sequence of five poems tied to the annual migratory sequence of the fish."

The City of Seattle held title to a 200+ acre park known as Washington Park located in a central portion of the city. The agreement was that the University could design, build, plant, and manage an Arboretum and Botanical Garden in this park. The Arboretum Foundation was founded in 1935 and has been an active participant ever since.The Graham Visitors Center, which is located on the north end of the Arboretum, not only serves to welcome the public, but also offers rental spaces that are available for meetings, classes, conferences, exhibitions, weddings, and many other social gatherings.

Seattle,"Pacific Science Center - Seattle, Washington - Engaging Diverse Communities through Interactive Science and Technology","The Pacific Science Center is located at 200 Avenue North in Seattle, Washington within walking distance of the Space Needle. It is a non-profit foundation that serves over a million people each year, in every Washington state county. The mission of the center is to inspire a lifelong interest in science, math, and technology by providing an interactive and innovative exhibition and program display.Minoru Yamasaki, the architect of the New York World Trade Center, designed the complex. The walls of each building, composed of many pre-cast concrete slabs, form an arch motif used by Yamasaki in a number of buildings. The Science Center began as the United States Science Pavilion during the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. Millions came to explore the wonders of science during the World's Fair and upon closing ceremonies, the Science Pavilion was given new life as the private not-for-profit Pacific Science Center, becoming the first U.S. museum founded as a science and technology center. On October 22, 2012 Pacific Science Center will celebrate its 50th year anniversary.Hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and closed December 24th at 3 p.m. and all day December 25th. Included with general admission exhibits tickets are six acres of hand-on science excitement, that include the Tropical Butterfly House, Planetarium, Discovery Carts, and Science Demonstration Stage shows.The Tropical Butterfly House opened December 26, 1998. The goal in creating this 4,000 square foot exhibit was to build an immersive display that would provide a glimpse into a part of a world very unlike Seattle - a warm, sunny place where colorful butterflies are active 365 days a year. Seattle skies do not provide the light necessary for tropical species to thrive. Supplemental heat, light, and humidity are provided to sustain a tropical ecosystem among the cool, gray, drizzly days of the Pacific Northwest. Approximately 500 tropical butterfly species are imported weekly from South and Central America, Africa, and Asia.The Willard Smith Planetarium engages its visitors in a welcoming, interactive learning environment where curiosity is embraced and ability to continue exploring is enhanced.

Seattle,"Washington State Ferries - Seattle, Washington - One of the Largest Fleets in the World","The Washington State Ferries are owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation and serve the communities of Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. The ferry system is one of the largest fleets of passenger and automobile ferries in the United States and ranked among the top five largest in the world.There are twenty-eight ferries that cross Puget Sound and its inland waterways, carrying over 26million passengers to 20different ports of call. From Tacoma, Washington, to Sidney, British Columbia, the ferries travel up and down the Sound, acting as a marine highway for commercial users, tourists, and daily commuters alike.In 1951 Washington State Ferries evolved with the state's buyout of Puget Sound Navigation. Ferry service around Puget Sound has changed tremendously over the course of the last century. Upon origination, Washington State recognized that the ferries were a lifeline for many communities and there was a need for reliable ferry service to meet growing demand. In 1951, after numerous discussions with the State Legislature over fares and service, the Puget Sound Navigation Company sold all of its terminal facilities and ferries for a meager $5 Million to a newly created Washington Toll Bridge Authority, now known as Washington State Ferries (WSF).The ferry system was originally intended to provide temporary service until a network of bridges could be built connecting the west and east sides of Puget Sound. However, in 1959, the legislature rejected the plan to build numerous cross sound bridges. At that time, the responsibility for managing the ferry system was shared by the Toll Bridge Authority and the State Highway Commission.WSF is the largest ferry system in the United States, serving eight counties within Washington and the Province of British Columbia in Canada. Counties served include Pierce, King, Snohomish, Kitsap, Skagit, Island, San Juan, and Jefferson Counties. WSF's existing system has 10 routes and 20 terminals that are served by 28 vessels.

Seattle,"Shi Shi Beach, Olympic National Park - One of the Most Beautiful Seascapes and Beaches in the Nation, with Trails that Abound","Shi Shi Beach is truly one of the most scenic spots along the Washington coast and is known as one of the best beaches in the nation for numerous reasons. Shi Shi has approximately two miles of walking beach to explore and while doing so it is difficult to keep your eyes from wandering. Whether it is the seascape in front of your eyes or the sand and tide pools, Shi Shi is not a location visitors will want to explore lightly. The sea stacks and beach caves with jetting tide pools, both shallow and deep, allow for great times of exploration.Taking in the sunset at the beach is amazing, but at Shi Shi the memory will be embedded for years to come. Here the sky lights up and reflects off the Pacific Ocean and glistening sand. Capturing the sunset on film is necessary in keeping the landscape alive even after you leave this amazing beach.The Northern entrance to Shi Shi is located on the Makah Reservation. From Port Angeles, travelers can drive west on U.S. 101 to Highway 112. Turn right onto Highway 112 and drive north to Neah Bay. At the west end of town, turn left onto Cape Flattery Road and drive 3 miles to Hobuck Beach Road. Turn left, cross the Watch River, and drive to Sooes River. Hobuck Beach Road eventually turns into Sooes Beach Road. Cross the Sooes River and drive to the trailhead on the right. This is the easiest route to get to the beach.Landowners near the trailhead allow visitors to park on their property for a small fee. This is advisable as parking at the trailhead is for day use only. Vandalism is a known problem in the area, so it is recommended that you park your vehicle at these locations.

The trail can be extremely muddy at times so proper attire is recommended.Pets are prohibited on the beach, even on leashes. Three pit toilets are available to visitors, one at the north end, near Bear Petroleum Creek, and one near Willoughby Creek. Water sources are also available at Petroleum Creek and Willoughby Creek. Most of the coastal water source facilities have a dark stained appearance from the tannin leached from leaves. Visitors are encouraged to boil, filter, and treat all water sources as girardia is known to exist in most of the coastal streams.In order to protect the area from coastal fires, campfires can only be built on the beach with driftwood. Due to raccoon problems, all food garbage and scented items must be secured in hard-sided containers such as Bear canisters. Wilderness camping permits are required for overnight hikes and can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center (WIC) in the city of Port Angeles."
Seattle,"Rialto Beach, Olympic National Park - A Great Beach Location with Many Camping Restrictions","Rialto Beach is one of the most popular beaches along the Olympic Peninsula and boasts some of the most awesome views of the Pacific Coast.

Seattle,"Ruby Beach, Olympic National Park - One of the Most Diverse Park's in the Nation Full of Scenery and Fog","Along the Olympic Peninsula of the state of Washington lies Ruby Beach.  This area is named for the rose-colored ruby gemstone fragments found in the coarse grey sand. As part of the Olympic National Park, the often foggy shoreline boasts a backdrop of mountains, glaciers, rain forests, and lots of wilderness and is one of the most diverse parks in the entire nation. Ruby Beach is located along the southwest coastal portion of the Olympic Park and is accessible directly off Highway 101.Although the area is called a beach, it is in no way fit for sun, surf, or outdoor sports. Swimming in this location is not allowed or desired. There are piles of bleached driftwood that have been carried on the shore by storms and waves and assemble a shore lined with pick-up sticks. The forests located up river periodically become flooded which cause trees to fall, and deliver the fallen debris and trees into the ocean. There is an overflow of tidal pools along the rocky shoreline where visitors can examine numerous marine creatures struggling to survive in the ebb and flow of the tides. Offshore rocks jet out of the water with their tops covered with the barest vegetation. Here you will find birds galore.Ruby Beach is located off the beaten track and as a result, the crowds are never huge. If visitors are looking for a quiet place to explore, this beach is the place. While wandering along the shoreline, explorers may come upon cliff caves that are open for discovery. The caves and rock formations or yesteryear are the backdrop for the rugged and rigid coastline. Today, large nesting colonies of birds, such as murres and tufted puffins make their dwellings in the rocks.Aside from swimming, there are so many activities to choose from in and around the park. Visitors could explore for two weeks straight and not discover all that can be investigated among Washington's Olympic Peninsula. Although, all of the eco-zones within the park can easily be experienced in just one day. From the coast, visitors can ascend nearly a mile high to Hurricane Ridge, which offers a visitor center and nature trails. From Hurricane Ridge, a three-hour drive to the west will bring you to the Hoh Rain Forest, which also has a visitor center, picnic area, and short nature trails leading through the tropical forest.Sunset at Ruby Beach is extraordinary as the entire sky lights up and reflects off the garnet fragments in the sand. Photographers and tourists gaze for hours collecting the perfect shot. When the lowering sun glints off the crushed garnets the sand is turned to a magnificent shade of rose. The area is known to be the place for romance. The backdrop of ember hues makes the entire sky reflect a fire tone that is unable to be duplicated. Nature at its finest dimension is found in this location."
Seattle,"Quinault Rain Forest, Olympic National Park - Seattle, Washington Temperate Rain Forest Located in the Great Northwest","The Quinault Rain Forest is one of four rich temperate rain forest canopies that lie within the western side of Washington's Olympic Mountains. The rain forest begins in the Mount Anderson drainage area and continues to the east and the Low Divide drainage to the northwest. The majestic forest follows the paths of the North and East Forks of the Quinault River. These forks meander down the valley and merge into one Quinault River, which enters beautiful Lake Quinault. The Quinault Rain Forest completely surrounds Lake Quinault and provides a scenic and beautiful destination.Moisture in the form of rain, drizzle and fog, and a valley open to southwesterly winds ensures the continuation of the life of a temperate rainforest. Rainfall in the area is measured by feet and not inches. There is an average of 10 to 15 feet, (120'' - 140'' up to 180'') of rainfall each year. Moisture is evident everywhere you look. Clouds, fog and forest growth help keep temperatures moderate summer and winter. This moisture and moderate temperature ensure plant growth and it is the rainfall that makes this area unique.Big Douglas firs, western red cedar and pacific silver fir dominate the main forest upper canopy. Adding to this rich dark green are the moisture dependent Sitka spruce and the western hemlock. The forest canopy is open, allowing streams of sunlight to reach the forest floor. These huge conifers along with the big leaf maple and alder along the river bars comprise first impressions for those visiting the Quinault Rain Forest.The Quinault Rain Forest is home to giant Douglas firs and several Roosevelt Elk herds. The elk are essential to the rain forest community. The elk stay year round in the Quinault Rain Forest, finding sufficient food and shelter. The herds live together in family units and travel to forage in familiar areas. They also travel from one river drainage to another. The elk herds play an integral part in the health and well being of the rain forest community.Also in the area are black bear, cougar, black-tailed deer, coyote, and many smaller mammals such as bobcat, beaver, river otter, raccoon, reside within the understory of the rain forest canopy. Their tracks are numerous, giving evidence of strong and growing populations.Bald eagle, golden eagle, osprey, hawk, blue heron, raven and crow are also visible in the area all along the river valley and at Lake Quinault. The eagles are abundant in the winter when there is a good salmon run. The eagles breed during the winter months. There are families of great Blue Heron that hunt along the pools and quiet river waters. Migratory Canadian geese, trumpeter swan, and a raft of smaller birds utilize the Quinault Rain Forest throughout the year.The Quinault Rain Forest is truly an ""enchanted valley'' that offers the visitor an awesome glance into the life of a temperate rain forest. The area has been limited in commercial development due for the variety of landowners."
Seattle,Olympic National Forest,"The Olympic National Forest is part of an emerald paradise. The Forest is located on the Olympic Peninsula in the northwest corner of Washington State (the Evergreen State).

Seattle,"Qwest Field - Seattle, Washington - Home of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks","Qwest Field is home to the NFL's Seattle Seahawks as well as Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC. It has also been host to an annual Washington State Cougars home game, as well as concerts by musicians such as P. Diddy, the Rolling Stones, and Metallica. There are also talks of the NCAA wishing to hold future soccer Final Four games at Qwest Field.Breaking ground in April 2000 and opening in 2002, Qwest Field is owned by the Washington State Public Stadium Authority and is operated by First & Goal Inc. It is located right at the junction of I-5 and I-90, making it easily accessible to fans traveling by car. The naming rights of what was formerly known as ""Seahawks Stadium'' were awarded to Qwest Communications International Inc. in an agreement made in June 2004. Qwest paid $75 million to keep the name for 15 years.With a seating capacity of 67,000, the three-tiered venue offers an additional 5,000 seats for special events, and 1,400 seats for those with disabilities. Unique to Qwest Field is a roof covering 70% of the stands, providing the fans with extra protection from the sun and harsh weather. Qwest Field was designed with the idea of bringing fans closer to the game. Endzone seats are 40' away from the field, with fans in the sideline seats being only 52' from the action. The stadium also offers ""Red Zone'' suites, field-level boxes that are the first of their kind. On-site parking is offered, with 3,100 spaces available. Alternative parking is available is surrounding lots, offering an additional 8,400 spaces. Due to a city ordinance, tailgating is not allowed at Qwest Field.""Hawk Nest'' is a massive tower on the north side of the field with 3,000 seats available to fans with a scoreboard located at the top of the 13-story structure. On the west side of the field is a pro shop to meet all the needs of even the most die-hard Seahawks fan. Qwest Field is easily one of the loudest fields in the NFL. Seahawks fans have been responsible for the false start of many opposing plays due to the stadiums unique design, which pushes as much crowd noise onto the field as possible. In recognition of this, and to encourage fans to make as much noise as possible, the Seahawks have kept track of the number of false starts made by opposing teams.In another act of fan appreciation, the Seahawks have posted a large flagpole in the south end zone which flies a blue flag with a number ""12''. This represents the ""12th man'', referring to the fans as a member of the team. In honor of this, the Seahawks have even gone as far as to retire the number 12 from their roster. The horseshoe shaped stadium's playing surface is FieldTurf. While easier to maintain than a natural grass field, this synthetic playing surface doesn't comply with FIFA regulations. In order to bring the field to code, First & Goal Inc. has agreed to pay for a natural grass field's installation in order to meet the FIFA standards."

Seattle,Seattle-Tacoma International Airport - Seattle WA Seattle Airport Flights,"The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been cheerily nicknamed Sea-Tac by the locals. The airport adopted the moniker and automated announcement now welcome guests referring to the building only by its nickname. More than 32 million people hear the announcement each year, as the airport serves Seattle, Tacoma and the greater Washington State region.The airport is marked by its relatively recent (for US airports) construction in the 1940's and the presences of a vibrant techie-innovation culture propelling it along to all the latest developments. Although the airport didn't start offering international flights until the 1960's, the presence of a large Boeing facility in the area means the runways are equipped to handle all the latest sizes of jumbo-jets for multi-national travel.The airport currently serves a variety of domestic and international destinations. Canadian and Pan-Asian flights figure heavily on the rotation. The airport is working to get more non-stop flights between Seattle and Chinese destinations like Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. There are low cost carriers at the airport, although the rising costs of flying in and out of Sea-Tac have caused friction in recent years. Southwest has repeatedly expressed interest in moving, but as of yet has not actually done so as a result of costs.Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is also in the middle of adding a link rail connection. Currently, the airport is served by bus line and car service only. Several main highways lead to the airport, and the loading and unloading areas see heavy traffic. Coupled with the overall high traffic in the Seattle area, this can lead to considerable congestion in peak travel times. Starting in 2009, there will be an Airport Station stop on the Sound Transit Central Link light rail line. The line will service downtown Seattle and offer connections to the surrounding area."
Seattle,"Woodland Park Zoo - Seattle, Washington - mid-size public zoo on 92 acres","Originally opened as a private zoo in 1887, Woodland Park Zoo began life as a menagerie created by a wealthy Seattle resident who generously shared his collection with the public. Guy C. Phinney, real estate developer and owner of a lumber mill, collected the animals in his menagerie as part of a 342-acre estate that also included a promenade, a mansion and a hunting lodge. The menagerie, which would eventually become the Woodland Park Zoo, was home to black bears and deer, as well as more exotic animals like African ostriches.After Phinney's death, the city of Seattle purchased Woodland Park for $100,000 over the objections of the Mayor and some members of the city council. Over the next 30 years, Woodland Park Zoo began to take shape. By 1930, the Woodland Park Zoo housed elephants, lions and tigers and bears, and many other animals. It also featured its own trolley run and a carousel and Ferris wheel. Visitors to the zoo could enjoy camel rides, visit apes and chimpanzees in the Primate House and stroll through a formal Rose Garden, which is still in existence and widely regarded as one of the finest in the nation.Today, 110 years after Phinny opened his menagerie to the public, the Woodland Park Zoo exhibits 1090 animals from 300 different species.

Boston,Boston Common: Rural Oasis in the Heart of the Big City of Boston Massachusetts,"Aerial view of the Charles River looking toward Cambridge and M.I.TIn the center of the city of Boston lies the oldest public park in the history of the United States. The nearly 50-acre Boston Common was established in 1634, initially for common pasture land. It was also the site of public hangings and was used for military purposes. During the war for independence it was the site of the British troop encampment prior to their departure in April of 1775 to the renowned battle of Lexington and Concord.Monuments to the War for Independence and dozens of other landmarks fill the downtown area and the park itself. The Visitor's Center in Boston Common is the departure point to see those sites along the Freedom Trail, which many a visitor and most Bostonians have embarked upon at least once.In past decades this park has served as the site of a diversity of major public speakers including Gloria Steinem, Martin Luther King Jr., and Pope John Paul II. It has also been the site for Boston activists to organize public demonstrations and protests throughout the last 100 years.Since March of 2008, debate has begun around limiting the number of large events allowed to occur in the park in order to limit the impact on the ecosystem and the parks natural beauty.It is the hills of the Boston Common where city children sled in the winter and skate on the frozen ""frog pond.'' In hot months that same skating rink becomes a wading pool, with sprinkler jets that cool the kids, giving parents some quiet time in the midst of a family picnic. Like any major city park, the summer is a scene of concerts, rollerblading and biking as well as the best people watching that Boston can offer. Of course the gallows were removed and the grazing came to a halt in the first half of the 19th century, prior to the public park system being created as such.Indeed it was in 1850 when the idea for a public park system first emerged. At that time the Boston Common was the only such public space. Finally in 1867 a law for Boston parks was approved by the Massachusetts State Legislature. Several years went by before, between 1878 and 1896, the Emerald necklace was created, based on the plan of the leading landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted.The necklace, which is anchored by Boston Common and the neighboring Public Garden is a seven-mile semi-circle of interconnected green spaces throughout Boston.While many rural areas are only a short trip outside of the city, the Boston Common and surrounding parks take the edge off city-life and by providing an oasis in the heart of this urban center."
Boston,"Boston Garden: The Only Name For World Class Sports And Events In Boston, Massachussetts","Boston Public GardenThe original Boston Garden opened its doors in November of 1928; it was constructed at a cost of 4 million dollars and had a capacity for 14,890 spectators. The first professional sports team to call the arena home was the Boston Bruins ice hockey team.For seventy years it would not only host thousands of regular season and championship games but also numerous civic and artistic events. Among the speakers that addressed a packed arena over the years were world leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. World class performing artists that played the Boston Garden included James Brown, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and scores of others. The ""Greatest Shows on Earth'' when in Boston, like the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus would be found at this indoor stadium.The most talked about legend of the Garden however, was the parquet floor on which the NBA team, the Boston Celtics, play. Said floor was installed in 1946 at the Boston Arena, with wood extracted from the forests of Tennessee by the Boston Lumber Company. The floor is said to have cost $11,000. At that time, the Celtics played their home games interchangeably at both the Boston Arena (which would later become the Matthews Arena) and the Boston Garden. In 1952 that floor was moved to the Boston Garden, which from that moment on became the exclusive home court of the Celtics until 1995, when the building was closed forever.The Celtics' parquet floor was the only part of the old structure however, that was moved to the new venue, initially named the Fleet Center. The Fleet Center opened on September 30, 1995, with a construction cost of 160 million dollars. It was built on 3.2-acres just nine inches away from the site of the original facility with a 19,580 capacity. In 1997 the old building was demolished.Over the years a myth had evolved around the Celtics frequent ability to compete for the championship based in the parquet floor. It was a said that the team could predict which way the ball would bounce off of any given section. But in late 1999 the last game was played on the old floor, (much of which, in reality, had been replaced over the years, one section at a time, due to damages from use.). On January 3, of 2000, a new floor was inaugurated beneath the treads of the team, although some sections of the old parquet floor have been recycled into this new floor, keeping this urban myth alive.The Parquet floor aside, the home team did have a distinct advantage in the original Boston Garden. The fans sat much closer to the players than in most stadiums as part of the design by boxing promoter Tex Rickard, who wanted the fans to see the sweat dripping off of two opponents in the ring. While this may have raised team morale for home players it almost surely hurt morale for visiting teams when the Boston fans got angry and were that much closer to the area of play.Despite that advantage, the old stadium had many problems like continuous electrical failures, no air conditioning and a non-regulation size hockey ring.The new facility was built to overcome the flaws in order to make fans even more comfortable at sporting events and other activities in a modern setting. Due to popular demand, by 2005 it was agreed to change the new buildings name to TD Banknorth Garden, which was immediately restored to Boston Garden by Bostonians.Today the Boston Garden continues to be home to the National Hockey League team of the Boston Bruins, the National Basket Ball Association team of the Boston Celtics and the National Lacrosse League team of the Boston Blazers.In addition to hosting major sports, music and entertainment events the multi-purpose arena already hosted a major political event, the 2004 Democratic National Convention.The facility received major upgrades only 10 years after it was built. In 2006, 20 million dollars were spent on, among other things, the construction of a 20,000 foot expansion of the North Station train concourse below the stadium and the installation of the first high definition scoreboard.With the local recognition and prestige of this name since 1928, any world class event in the City of Boston will continue to be held at the Boston Garden for the coming decades."

Boston,General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport - Boston MA General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport Flights,"The General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport's name isn't the only big thing about it. Logan, as it is called for short, is the biggest airport in New England. Busier than Atlanta and San Francisco, Logan serves as a focus city for several carriers and more than 26 million passengers cross through its 2400 acres each year.Although it is a major economic force in the area, the airport has not always been popular. The land used for the airport had a mix of prior uses. One of the airport's longest runways lies over a former neighborhood where residents were forcibly relocated using eminent domain in the 1970s.  Another section was built using landfill waste to extend the airport grounds into Boston Harbor. The landfill project was the butt of many jokes, but did allow for ground to be repurposed instead of being left idle.In General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport got its first new runway in 40 years, in a move that was designed to add capacity and reduce noise. The new runway reduces the amount of flying done overland in the Boston area. As the new runway approach route does water take-offs and landings, travelers will want to grab window seats more often to get a great view over the Boston area by sea.Getting to Logan by land is possible by car, bus, ferry or rail. The South Station of the MBTA Silver Line connects with all the Logan terminals. Somewhat oddly for non-natives, the Blue Line's Airport Stop does not arrive at the airport, but getting off at the stop does give access to shuttles that go to and from the airport. The water shuttle is accessed by taking a shuttle from the terminal to the dock and negotiating with the water taxis waiting there. Cab and limousine service is regulated and managed by Massport at each terminal."

Boston,Boston Public Garden - Massachusetts - Large Park in the Heart of Boston,"The Public Garden, also known as the Boston Public Garden, is a large park in the heart of Boston, Massachusetts, near Boston Common. The Public Garden was established in 1837 when philanthropist Horace Gray asked for the use of land as the first public botanical garden in the United States. Gray helped to marshal political resistance to a number of Boston City Council is trying to sell the land in question, finally resolve the question of devoting the public garden in 1856.The Act establishing the land use was submitted to the voters on April 26, 1856 where it passed with only 99 dissents. Today the north side of the lake is a small island, but originally was a peninsula, connected to land. The site became so popular with fans of the John Galvin, the city forester, decided to cut the connection to the earth.The landscape of twenty-four hectares, which was once a marsh, was designed by George F. Meacham. The paths and flower beds were placed by the city engineer, James Slade and Forestry, John Galvin. The plan for the garden includes a series of fountains and statues. The first statue was erected by Edward Everett William Wetmore Story, in November 1867 in the northern part of the garden, near Beacon Street. The bronze statue of George Washington by Thomas Ball, which dominates the west side of the park, was dedicated on 3 July 1869. The firm suspension bridge in the middle of the lake was built in 1867.The public garden is run jointly between the Office of the Mayor, the Parks Department of the City of Boston, and friends of the non-profit public gardens. It was declared a National Historic Monument in 1987.Along with the Boston Common, these two parks form the northern terminus of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. While the common open space is largely unstructured, the Public Garden contains a lake and a series of formal plantings that are maintained by the city and others, and vary from season to season.During the warmer seasons, the four acre pond is usually the home of one or more of the swans and is always the site of the Swan Boats, a famous tourist attraction in Boston. For a small fee, tourists can sit on a boat decorated with a white swan in the back. The boat is then pedaled around the lake by a tour guide sitting on the swan.The Public Garden is rectangular and is bounded on the south by Boylston Street, west of Arlington Street, and north of Beacon Street, where it faces Beacon Hill. On its east side, Charles Street divides the common public garden. The greenway that connects the public garden, with the rest of the Emerald Necklace is a strip of park that runs west through the center of Commonwealth Avenue to the marshes of Back Bay and the river of mud."

Boston,"Charlestown Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Irish Influence that Still Exists Today","Charlestown is located north of Boston proper on a peninsula extending southeast between the Charles River and the Mystic River. The geographical extent of the area has changed drastically since its colonial ancestry. Landfill operations have expanded dramatically, from Boston, down mountains, and have expanded into Charlestown, eliminating the Charlestown narrow neck connecting the northwest tip of the peninsula of Charlestown to the mainland.The original territory included present Somerville, which was incorporated as a separate city in 1842, as well as the northern part of Arlington. At the time, Charlestown proper was urbanizing, while Somerville was still largely rural.Charlestown is a part of the city of Boston, Massachusetts, situated on a peninsula north of Boston proper. Charlestown was originally an independent city and the first capital of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, which later became a city in 1847 and was annexed by Boston on 5 January 1874. While there has been a major U.S. population influx from Ireland since the Irish emigration during the Irish famine of the 1840s, the neighborhood has changed substantially due to its proximity to the center of colonial architecture and City Square since the late 1980s.The Bridge and Old Bridge Warren, was formerly a stop on the high Charlestown. The central artery was built between 1951 and 1954, routing via ramps for lifting the Town Square. The Area of North Central Artery (CANA) of this project was moved underground tunnel in the city square, giving way to a revitalized surface fleet.Charlestown contains several historic sites, many of which are marked by the north end of Boston's Freedom Trail. The Freedom Trail ends at the Bunker Hill Monument commemorating the famous Battle of Bunker Hill. The USS Constitution, the oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, is docked in the Charlestown Naval Shipyard.Charlestown was also the place from which Paul Revere began his famous ""midnight ride"" before the battles of Lexington and Concord. A local restaurant called the Warren Tavern opened in 1780 and is still in operation. The Warren Tavern claims to have been one of Revere's favorite taverns.Throughout the 1960s until the mid-1990, Charlestown was infamous for its Irish mafia presence. The Charlestown McLaughlin Brothers were involved in a gang war with neighboring Somerville Winter Hill Gang during the wars of the Irish mob in the 1960s. In late 1980, however, Charlestown underwent a massive gentrification process similar to that of the South End. Attracted by its proximity to downtown and its colonial, red brick row house dwellings, similar to Beacon Hill, many professionals from the upper middle class, moved into the neighborhood. In late 1990, additional gentrification took place, similar to that in neighboring Somerville. Today the neighborhood is a mix of upper-middle and middle-class residences, housing projects and a large working class Irish-American population and culture that still dominates to this day."

Focused on Beach Street, the neighborhood borders along Boston Common and Downtown Crossing. To the far south is Highway Southeast or Massachusetts Turnpike.Part of it occupies a floor space reclaimed by filling the tides or tidal flat and the newly built area was first settled by the Anglo-Bostonians. After residential properties in this area became less desirable due to the development of railways, which was settled by a mixed sequence of Ireland, the Jewish immigrants, Italian, Syrian, and Chinese. Each group replaces the former to take advantage of low cost housing and employment opportunities in the area. During the late nineteenth century, the manufacturing plants of clothing also moved to Chinatown, the garment creation of the historic district of Boston.The garment district was active until the 1990s. Negotiations culminated in the provision of funds for the construction of new housing in the Chinatown community. During this period, city officials also designated an area adjacent to Chinatown and Boston's red light district, also known as the combat zone.The traditional Chinatown Gate (paifang) with foo lion on each side is at the intersection of Beach Street and the road surface. The Gate is visible from the southern bus terminal and is a popular tourist destination and great photo opportunity.Chinatown offers excellent local and regional transport.

South Cove volunteers founded it in 1972, to provide better health care for Asian Americans in the Chinatown area.In recent years, a new satellite Chinatown has been rapidly emerging approximately 10 miles south on Hancock Street in the nearby city of Quincy. This is due to the rapid influx of Hokkien-speaking mainland Chinese immigrants from Fujian Province and a large and growing population of Vietnamese origin. There are already several large Asian supermarkets, such as food and Man Kam Super 88 supermarket chains and other businesses that compete with Boston's Chinatown. Several companies operating in Chinatown now have branches in Quincy."

Its field appearance attracts skateboarders and, in general, young people of secondary schools and kids from surrounding neighborhoods that have been associated with the countercultural movements such as punk, hardcore, straight edge, and gothic subcultures. The contrast between the faithful and often older and more conservatively dressed people associated with nearby Harvard University and the businesses in the square occasionally leads to tension. Harvard sports teams and clubs, including the track teams and all male social clubs, are known to make use of this contrast, by encouraging or sometimes require new members to participate in humorous or humiliating performances in ""The Pit ""As part of these members' initiation into the group.One block east of the pit, an outdoor cafe tables always have availability for chess players, including Murray Turnbull, with his ever-present ""Play"", the ""sign of Chessmaster.''"

The Zoo is operated by Zoo New England, which also manages the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, MA.Originally established in 1905 as Middlesex Fells Zoo, the park was renamed in honor of long-time zoo director Walter D. Stone in 1969. The zoo was a popular area attraction through the 1970s and 1980s, but fell into disrepair when the state of Massachusetts cut all funding to the zoo in 1990 and shut it down. The public rose up and came together to call for the Stone Zoo to remain open, and the state Senate took up the cause, helping to set up a non-profit corporation to collect donations and manage the zoo as a private entity. Unfortunately, the transition was a rocky one, and the zoo lost most of its large animals and its accreditation.In the early years of the 2000s, Zoo New England, the non-profit corporation that runs both Stone Zoo and Franklin Park Zoo stepped up fund raising efforts with publicity and a series of high profile events to bring the zoo back to life. In a few short years, the zoo has renovated and added several new exhibits.

Baltimore,Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport Baltimore MD - Baltimore Airport Flights,"The Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is in neither Baltimore nor Washington, sitting in an open area south of Baltimore and a good 30 min drive from D.C. However, a bit of open space was necessary to accommodate the area's fastest growing airport. The number of passengers served annually is over 20 million, with AirTran and Southwest pulling down the majority of the travelers.The airport holds the unique distinction of having been voted as one of the nation's healthiest airports by Health Magazine in 2008. In 2010, it will turn 60 years old. However, it has been frequently updated throughout its lifetime, including a recent renovation that combined its five concourses to four, making it easier to navigate the airport. The airport also consolidated its rental car area, offering a quick shuttle to the removed rental station which has all eight of the rental agencies under one roof.Those looking to come to the greater D.C. area for a leisurely vacation are probably best served by flying into BWI, as the airport is commonly known. The smaller layout makes the airport easier to navigate for families and those with crowd or mobility challenges. Additionally, the presence of multiple low-cost carriers means that rates will be cheaper than a Reagan or Dulles flight in most cases. This is also true on the short-hop Caribbean flights offered by the airports. For those coming from Dulles or Reagan, transfers and shuttle services to and from the city are available.Getting to downtown D.C. will be a bigger challenge than getting into Baltimore, especially if one is driving. However, the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport was the first airport to have a dedicated intercity rail connection, so travelers will want to take the train where possible. It connects with both Baltimore (10 min) and D.C. ( 35 min) systems through the Northeast Corridor connection."

Baltimore,Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in Maryland,"Fort McHenry is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is one of the most distinguishable national monuments due to its unique shape. The Fort McHenry is shaped in the form of a star and played a major role in the War of 1812. During the war of 1812, British ships bombed the fort for 25 hours straight before ceasing their attack in frustration. It is estimated that more than a 1000 Americans selflessly defended Fort McHenry and it was their strength that saved America from defeat.  The determination of the soldiers and the stability of Fort McHenry helped to successfully defend the city of Baltimore from being demolished by the British navy. The fort never suffered further attacks after the battle but did remain an active military post off and on for a hundred years. It wasn't until 1925, that the fort was made a national park. It was placed on the National Register of Historic places until 1966.One of the most prominent features of the fort is the role that the fort played in producing the national anthem of the United States. Francis Scott Key was inspired to write The Star-Spangled Banner, a poem that would eventually transform into the song that embodies the spirit of America. The Fort is now owned and operated by the U.S. Government's National Park System.In 1939, Fort McHenry was designated as a national monument and historic shrine. It is the only historic place in the United States to have a double-designation. The war of 1812, the historic architecture of the unique building, and birth of the national anthem has made Fort McHenry one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the country. Local Baltimore residents flock to the area, using it as a vital center of recreation. It is estimated that thousands of people attend the monument each year. A Visitor Center located on the premises of the Fort gives visitors the chance to get acclimated to the history by viewing a short orientation film called the ""The Defense of Fort McHenry."" The Visitor Center also offers additional services such as talks, and detailed walking tours of the fort. American patriots frequent Fort McHenry in order to pay tribute and respects to their fallen countrymen and nation.One of the most interesting things that occurs at the Fort are the historical re-enactments that take place by a group called the Fort McHenry Guard. The guard is a group of patriotic volunteers that dress up in period-costumes and perform a full re-enactment of the Battle that took place in Baltimore. Many of the volunteers of the Fort McHenry Guard are history buffs and retirees who are anxious to do the reenactment every September during Defenders Day.A celebration called Defenders Day is held at the fort every year. The event commemorates the soldiers who lost their lives at the Battle of Baltimore, and is the biggest event held at the Fort. The event includes a myriad of programs, activities, and a final fireworks display as a finale."

Baltimore,Museum Celebrating History of Lacrosse,"The LaCrosse Hall of Fame in Baltimore, Maryland is a great place to visit if you are a fan of the game or if you would like to learn more about the game. The museum is located at 113 West University Parkway, next to the Homewood Field on the campus of Johns Hopkins University.

Hopkins is no exception to this and their lacrosse team continues to excel, while carrying on the tradition of the game.The museum illustrates the history of lacrosse from its introduction to early European settlers by the Native Americans. It was one of many stickball games they shared, but the game lost popularity because it was associated with gambling. On Indian reservations, lacrosse was often a violent event and had few regulations. Often, hundreds of people would be on the field, and few considered the game civilized. Many Europeans also felt it interfered with church attendance.Museum exhibits include rare photos, vintage equipment, and uniforms.

Featuring 1,894 custom speakers, it can take as many as 25 people to operate the two screens.In the movie The Replacements (2000), starring Keanu Reeves, M&T Bank Stadium was used as the location of the home field for the fictitious team, the Washington Sentinels. On the southwest plaza sidewalk is a piano key mosaic. This mosaic is in honor of the Knabe Piano Factory, which was replaced by the M&T Bank Stadium after the company relocated. Another memorial found in the venue is dedicated to former Baltimore Colts quarterback, Johnny Unitas, who passed away in September 2002. In the northwest corner of the venue is Unitas Plaza, named in his honor with a bronze statue dedicated to the former football star."

Baltimore,Historic Tourist Photo Opportunity,"The Phoenix Shot Tower is a landmark in downtown Baltimore that has been a part of the skyline since the mid-1800's. It is also known as the Old Baltimore Shot Tower and was originally called the Merchant's Shot Company. The tower reaches 234.25 feet tall and is entirely constructed by 1 million red brick. Completed in 1828, it was the tallest free-standing structure in the United States at the time and remained so until the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. was constructed. In 1971, it was designated a national landmark. Designed by Jacob Wolfe, the first cornerstone of the building was laid by Charles Carroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.When in operation, The Shot Tower was used in the production of amunition for pistols, shotguns, and cannons. Molten lead was dropped from a platform at the top of the structure. As it would fall through the tower, it would shape and cool, and would splash into a pool of cold water at the bottom. The water served to harden the shot into a solid piece of lead and it would then be bagged into 25 pound sacks. During a regular year, annual production was 100,000 bags. This number would increase during wartime.The tower ended its active production in 1892, but reopened briefly in the 1900's. It has since become a part of Baltimore culture, recognized by native Baltimoreans as a significant part of the city's history. It has long been a popular destination for school field trips, and is a great side trip from the Harbor or other downtown neighborhoods. It is a quick trip, and is an excellent photo opportunity.

Baltimore,Sight of The Preakness Race,"Pimlico Race Course is one of Maryland's most well-sought out locations. Pimlico can trace its history back to the 1660's when English settler's named the area in honor of a popular watering hole in London known as Olde Ben's Pimlico tavern. The racetrack is still sometimes called Old Hilltop due to the rise in the infield. The racetrack opened officially in 1870 and a colt called Preakness won the first race held there, The Dinner Party Stakes. Three years later, this race was renamed the Preakness in honor of this first winner.In 1938, the famous horse Sea Bisquit raced at Pimlico, beating War Admiral in the second race of the Triple Crown. Both the Preakness and the Pimlico Stakes are 1 3/16th of a mile. Information concerning wagering at the races can be found on their website. Preakness brings Marylanders to Pimlico in droves, some to observe the state's long tradition of horse breeding and racing, and those who want to celebrate with their friends and welcome spring gathered in the infield of the race. Preakness is now the second race in horse racings coveted Triple Crown, although they have often run the three races in different orders. The winning horse is presented with The Woodlawn Vase. The horse and jockey that sits atop the tracks weathervane is painted the colors of the winning jockey and they remain that way until the following year's race.The winning horse is also covered by the famed Black-Eyed Susan blanket.

Baltimore,Historic Garden to Delight Families,"Sherwood Gardens is one of the best known destinations in the Baltimore area for a pleasant spring stroll, a place to enjoy fall foliage, and a great place for a delicious summer picnic. The garden is one block east of the 4100 block of St. Paul Street, and is convenient to a number of downtown Baltimore neighborhoods. Located in the Guilford neighborhood, the gardens originally were part of the estate of A.S. Abell, founder of Baltimore's daily newspaper, The Baltimore Sun. The land on which the garden now lies was originally a pond. In 1912 when the property was developed for housing, the pond was filled in, allowing the rich, moist soil to later be used for gardens.During the 1920's, the plot that was formally the pond was turned into a garden by John W. Sherwood. He was a local petroleum pioneer and conservationist and began the garden as a hobby. The tulips he planted in the garden were imported directly from the Netherlands, and as the garden has grown and become more popular, it has gained noteriety as the most famous tulip garden in North America.At the time of Mr. Sherwood's death in 1965, he bequeathed enough money to the city of Baltimore for one full year of care and maintenance for his garden. After that, the Guilford Association took control of the gardens and have maintained the gardens ever since. On occasion, the City of Baltimore contributes money to the care and maintenance of the gardens, knowing their popularity and understanding the value the gardens add to the area.Today the garden is home to approximately 80,000 tulip bulbs that are newly planted each spring. There are a variety of other spring bulbs included with the tulips, and the garden also features a variety of dogwood trees, flowering cherry trees, wisteria, and magnolia trees. There are also azalea bushes and Old English boxwood trees. The garden's bulbs are in full bloom from the end of April until the beginning of May. On the Saturday preceeding Memorial Day, the garden holds a tulip dig. As the blooms die off, visitors to the garden can dig up this season's bulbs and take them home for planting in their own gardens. Visitors pay for the bulbs and are required to bring shovels, spades, and bags to transport their bulbs. The following year, new bulbs are planted at Sherwood Gardens, allowing the plant, bloom, and dig cycle to happen again.Throughout the summer, the garden remains in bloom through the Adopt-A-Plot program. Colorful annuals are planted by area residents who maintain their small plots of land. The park is open year round, and has no gates or fences restricting access to the area. Winter strolls down the snowy pathways may be chilly, but will offer lovely views of glistening trees and snow-covered fields. Admission to the park is completely free. The next time you are in the Guilford neighborhood, take a stroll through the six acre area known as Sherwood Gardens and enjoy the grandeur of nature in full, colorful bloom."

Baltimore,Resting Place of Edgar Allan Poe,"The Westminster Church Cemetary is one of the most visited non-operational churches in the United States. Declared a national historic district in 1974, the church is the burial site of a variety of prominent Baltimore citizens including the cities first mayor, Francis Scott Key's son, and James McHenry, one of the signers of the Constitution. The church is located at 519 West Fayette Street, within walking distance of the Baltimore Convention Center and both Baltimore sports stadiums.The site of the church was originally only a graveyard. It was established in 1786 by the First Presbyterian Church which was a parish of some of the most economically and socially elite in Baltimore. Over the course of 60 years, the cemetary became the final resting place for statesmen, merchants, politicians, and dozens of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 veterans.In 1852, a church was built over the graveyard. The graves later became known at the catacombs. The church was built as a means of serving Baltimore's west end population. Their intention was to protect the graveyard which was at risk for being considered an uncouth manner of burying the deceased. Those supporting the cemetary and church wanted to leave the graves as they were, and decided that building a church over them would offer the protection needed to leave those buried there at peace.It was in 1849 the graveyard received its most well-known arrival. Born in 1809, Edgar Allen Poe is the author of macrabre pieces of literature like The Fall of the House of Usher and The Pit and the Pendulum. Also a poet, Poe wrote The Raven and The Conqueror Worm. Nearly 30 years after Poe was buried at Westminster Church Cemetary, an area teacher began a program called Pennies for Poe. School children donated pennies that were used to fund a substantial monument for Poe's grave. Buried with him are his grandfather, brother, wife, and mother-in-law. To this day, visitors leave pennies on his monument in honor of the Pennies for Poe campaign.The church is also the home of the Poe House and Museum. As the site of his annual birthday celebration, the church and catacombs attract a variety of Poe fans, all there to celebrate his life and work. Since 1949, a mysterious stranger creeps into the graveyard on Poe's birthday, offers a toast to the macabre author, and places a bottle of Martell cognac and three red roses on his grave. The stranger wears black, carries a cane, and covers his face with a scarf or hood. No one has ever spoken to this stranger. It is believed a new person began carrying out the tradition, based on letters that were left at the site of the grave, explaining the passing of the baton in respect to the family tradition. The stranger has even been known to creep in while the birthday celebration is in full swing.If you are a fan of dark tales, or possess interest in the literary arts, be sure to pay a visit to the Westminster Church Cemetary while visiting Baltimore. It is a dark experience you will not soon forget."

Denver,"United States Mint, Denver, CO - Mint","While you are visiting Denver, CO, you have the opportunity to visit one of the few facilities of the United States Mint. While there are several places that produce money for the United States, there are only two places that offer tours - the one in Denver and the one in Philadelphia. It would be an excellent place to take the whole family and see where - and how - our money is made.A tour of the Mint enables members of your family or group the opportunity to learn about the mint process, and see some of the history of the Mint. They get to learn about what it takes to make money. This includes the making of original designs, to the sculptures, and the actual striking processes in coin making.The Mint in Denver started producing coins in 1906, but it did not start there. The current building is actually the third one that was handling money - often in gold and silver. In the early days of the Colorado Gold Rush, miners had no place to bring their gold. Businessmen opened the first building for the purpose of minting gold coins.This business was later purchased by the government in 1863 - during the Civil War. It turned gold and silver into bars for the next 50 years - but no coins were made. Finally, in 1906, it began producing pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. For a while it also produced coins for Mexico, Israel and Argentina, but stopped in 1984.Besides manufacturing the lower denomination coins, the Mint is also responsible to produce ""proofs"" for coin collectors and coins of special metals such as gold, silver and platinum. The Mint also produces official medals, too.Tours allow people to go into the Mint and see the processes involved. They do not actually go into the spaces where the coins are being produced, but can view the processes from above. This allows visitors to be able to see everything going on unhindered.Tours of the Mint are free. They are limited to about 50 people per tour and it is better if reservations are made in advance. Groups of 20 people or less can make reservations online, but groups between 20 to 50 people must call in their reservation. Although people may be permitted in who do not have a reservation (standby tickets are offered at the door), they may only be allowed in if another group cancels, or if there is room and the 50 person limit is not met. Reservations can be made online.The United States Mint is under the auspices of Homeland Security and precautions are in force. This means that every person must go through scanners and many items are not permitted. They are rather strict and the list may change of what is permitted and what is not. Be sure to go online to find the current list. Backpacks are not allowed, nor are carry bags - including diaper bags, to name just a few. Cameras are not permitted.A gift shop contains a number of items, especially those that encourage saving and collecting coins.

Denver,"Molly Brown House Museum, Denver, CO - Museum","Molly Brown was well known for being one of the survivors of the Titanic disaster. Her story is well known, and her house has been well preserved so that people everywhere can see how she lived. The Molly Brown House Museum in Denver, CO, enables visitors to see the beauty of this elegant home.Although she grew up in a very modest home, her husband later became very rich after discovering silver in a mine. As was typical of the wealthier people in Denver, they had a new home built in Capitol Hill in 1889.They hired architect William Lang to provide them with designs and build their new home. It was to be elegant, and it was to have everything in it that was considered modern at the time - including electricity, running water, and steam heat.Molly Brown had gained her reputation from a song written about her. Although they were already well known, she had booked passage on the Titanic to travel and see Egypt, Rome, and Paris. She traveled with her daughter and her friends J.J. and Madeleine Astor.When the Titanic hit the iceberg, Molly was thrown out of her bed onto the floor. She then discovered what had happened, helped some people, and was quickly put on the first lifeboat. Although it could hold 65 people, the lifeboat was sent away with only 24 on board. After about four hours at sea, they were picked up by the Carpathia. Arriving back in New York, a crowd of 30,000 people awaited the news. When asked what she credited her survival to, she simply said ""Typical Brown luck. We're unsinkable.""The Browns lived in this home for many years. She died after her husband in 1932. The house has been restored with period furniture and the elegance that it had when the ""unsinkable Molly Brown"" was alive.The Museum also has a Victorian Dinner Experience. These are public events and include their elegant settings, as well as a tour. Some of the events include Teas (Cream Tea, Full Tea, and a High Tea), a Luncheon that includes sherry and smokehouse almonds, a main entree, a salad, rice or potato, rolls, and a dessert. The Titanic Dinner is their most elegant and it comes complete with a candlelight tour of the mansion. The dinner is certainly reminiscent of the grand elegance of the Titanic and it includes an eight-course menu. There are also luncheons and teas for children's groups.Events can be planned at the Molly Brown House, which could provide the perfect motif for your event. The event rooms are on the third floor, however, and they are not accessible.Visitors can see the Molly Brown House by taking a tour through it. All tours are guided and take about 45 minutes.

Denver,"Cheesman Park, Denver, CO - Park","A very popular park in the heart of Denver, CO is called the Cheesman Park. This park has been around for a long time and is a favorite of many of the wealthier neighbors who live around it.The Park dates back to around the turn of the century and was officially named in 1907. The present borders of the park are, however, somewhat unclear in places even today. It lies next to the Denver Botanic Gardens.Walter Cheesman owned the property that included the land where Cheesman Park is now, the land of the Denver Botanical Gardens, and also the land of the Congress Park. At the time, it was the Prospect Hill Cemetery, which was largely disused. The cemetery was loosely divided into several sections, and each group was largely responsible for their own section - which was neglected.This Park has an interesting history and still there are a number of questions unanswered. After a while, it was discovered that the cemetery's land was actually owned by the government through a treaty with the Arapaho Indians. This meant that the bodies would have to be removed - within 90 days. In the process, a scandal was discovered. The contractor was cheating on how much he was charging and other problems. This resulted in thousands of bodies never being moved - they are still buried on the land of both Cheesman Park and also underneath the Denver Botanical Gardens. A lot of grave robbing was also known to have taken place.The beautiful pavilion that stands on the park grounds is also believed to have covered up bodies, as well. Anyway, some of the first people in the cemetery were known to be criminals and had been hanged. This has resulted in many tales of hauntings over the years. In fact, the film The Changeling is based on some of these reported experiences.A large part of the park is open space and this makes it the ideal place for walking, sports, or other activities. The trail around the park is gravel. It is the perfect place for jogging, walking, picnicking, and sports. A children's playground is also available.For those who go to the park, they will find that it provides an excellent view of the region. Visitors can see Pike's Peak and Mt. Evans, as well as other beautiful mountains and other sights.After you have been to Cheesman Park in Denver, CO, you have opportunity to see many other places that are really great for the whole family. This includes the Denver Botanical Gardens, which are right next door. There are many different gardens here and exotic plants from all over the world. One of the gardens is a replica of One that was at Mount Vernon - George Washington's home.When you get hungry, there are a number of restaurants and fast food places in the neighborhood - which is also called Cheesman Park. You can take your pick of the style of food you want, and you can be sure that it will be good, too. You can especially find ethnic foods, which includes Chinese, Korean, Thai, Ethiopian, Moroccan, and more."

Denver,"Tiny Town, Denver, CO - Attraction","The creation of Tiny Town in Denver, CO took place about a century ago - in 1915. At that time, the owner of a moving company, George Turner, began constructing houses that were one-sixth size. He made them originally for his daughter, but later opened them up to the public just five years later. In another five years, the attraction had become one of Colorado's favorite.There are a wide variety of buildings in Tiny Town, some of them are very unique. The village is built in a valley and it is designed after an old Western town. All of them, of course, are amazingly detailed. You can expect to see houses, hotels, churches, stores, and businesses. Some of the businesses that you will see replicas of include Stanley Mill, The Fort, Arvada Flour Mill, Argo Gold Mill, Coney Island Hot Dog, and the Victorian fire station in Denver (Station #1).A special railway was created for the town in 1939. This made it even more popular than ever. The train is also one-sixth size and is the perfect size to take families around the little town. Visitors can now ride the tiny train on a one-mile course. There are a couple of different engines - both steam and diesel. The train ride takes about 10 minutes and goes over Turkey Creek, Tweety Town and past Dinosaur Hill.One of the engines that is occasionally at Tiny town is called the 1904 Cagney. This engine was first run in the 1904 world's fair that was held in St. Louis. A machine shop nearby actually did the machine work on the engine enabling it to run again.After a couple of floods, the town had nearly been destroyed. There were more than 125 buildings at that time. Over time, different groups have helped rebuild some of the houses and buildings so that now there are nearly 100 of them - all of them built one-sixth size. The houses are very detailed and the kids can look in the windows and see what is inside each of the furnished houses.This year something new happened that had not been done in Tiny Town since 1989. The town was lit up with Christmas lights in an effort to bring some hope to people who had been hurt from the economic problems in our country. The lighted houses can be seen from the road, and pictures can be taken.The town is still growing. One building that people can expect to see soon is the Tara from ""Gone with the Wind."" This is actually replacing an earlier Tara that had been destroyed in a flood. Other important landmarks around Denver can also be seen in Tiny Town. Some of the buildings are also imaginary. Some of the buildings can also be crawled into, giving the children even more fun.When the family has finished seeing the town and going on the train, there is a large playground for them. A gift shop offers many different items for souvenirs and other train-related items. A concession stand offers ice cream, hot dogs, and other refreshments.Or, you may want to pack your own lunch and have a picnic on the playground. It would be a great way to end a tour of Tiny Town.The Tiny Town is located about 30 minutes from the downtown area of Denver. It is open from May through September between the hours of 10 AM to 5 PM. In the months of May and September, however, it is only open on weekends, between 10 AM until 5: PM."

Denver,"Mount Evans, Denver, CO - Scenic","Mount Evans in Denver, CO has to be probably one of the most scenic roads in the United States. Being that it is the highest paved road in North America, the view from the top is absolutely incredible. Seeing Colorado from this height would be a great trip for the whole family.The road to the top of Mt. Evans has held the honor of being the highest road for a long time. Around the turn of the century, the cities of the area - Colorado Springs and Denver - were competing to bring out tourists from the east. When Colorado Springs completed the road to the top of Pike's Peak, it did succeed in gaining tourists - and taking them away from the Denver area. Soon, though, Denver had its own idea.It was in 1917 that the dirt road to the top of Mt. Evans was started. Taking 10 years to complete, it was finally finished in 1927. Then, it was paved during the 1930's. Later a restaurant and souvenir shop was opened at the top, but this burned down in 1979 and it was never rebuilt. The foundation and a rock wall, however, are still in place. They make a great place to stand on and observe the surrounding valleys and nearby mountains.Mount Evans is a total of 14, 264 feet high from sea level. The road, which is completely paved, is fourteen miles to the top. From there, you can take just a short walk of about two blocks to the peak.On the road to the top you will see the beautiful Summit Lake. This gorgeous lake has a number of trails around it. There is also a rest area by it. In some areas, you can listen to rangers talk about certain features and give some history - including information about the 1,700-year-old bristle cone trees that are there. Echo Lake is another place to stop and enjoy the view. Fishing is permitted, too.While on the road to the top, there certainly are many places to stop and take some excellent pictures. You may also see some of the various forms of wildlife on the mountain, which includes white mountain goats and Bighorn sheep, deer, elk, picas, marmots, and squirrels.As you go up and when you reach the top, you will notice nearly breath-taking scenery all around. On clear days, you can see mountain peaks and valleys many miles away. You may even see a thunderstorm below in one of the valleys. Of course, you certainly do not want to forget your camera.Another structure on top of the mountain is the Meyer-Womble Observatory, which has been there since 1996. Up until the year 2,000, this observatory had been the highest one in the world. The Denver University runs it.There are a number of places to see while you are on Mount Evans. In order to see, them, though, you will need to make plans to do so. You can learn more at their Website. There are picnic areas, a number of campsites, and some of them are accessible (Mount Goliath Natural Area).Mount Evans near Denver, CO is very seasonal. The road is accessible only from the end of May until the end of September. You should also be aware that there is a great temperature difference between Denver and the top of the mountain.

This impressive Italianate home was built in 1883 and is now restored with the elegance it once had.The builders of the home, Mr. and Mrs. William Newton Byers built the home and lived there for six years. He was the publisher of the Rocky Mountain News, which is still in operation today. It was then sold to William Grey Evans, who was an officer in the Denver Tramway Company. Evans was also the son of the second territorial governor of Colorado, with whom Byers had helped to promote many large state and city projects.There is no doubt that these two names - Byers and Evans - are among the most influential people in the early history of Denver. Many of Denver's important civic institutions, including hospitals, libraries, museums, and much more, were planned and built through the instrumentality of these two men. In addition, there are also two mountain peaks nearby that honor both men.The last child of the Evans family, Margaret (daughter of William and Cornelia), had married a man named Davis. Once her husband died, she joined her two sisters and lived in the home with them. Eventually, they all spent the rest of their lives living in the Byers-Evans home. She lived in the home until she died in 1981. At that time, it was given to the Colorado Historical Society, and they have turned it into a museum.You can see in this home a lot of the furniture, furnishings, and elegant decorations that the family enjoyed over the years. Since it was lived in by its original family members, even some of their collections remained in the home after they had died. The family also did little in the way of major renovations or additions.The tour of the home starts with a movie about the home and the residents. It provides background information and scenes of what will be seen on the tour.The museum contains many photographs of the residents who lived here.

This 1923 Kissel Speedster with a 6-cylinder engine is in excellent shape and was owned by Amelia from 1924 to 1929. Other Kissel models, including the ""Gold Bug,"" are also in the museum.The largest vehicle that is on display is the Big Boy Locomotive. These massive train engines were built during WWII to move materials across the mountains rapidly. Only 25 of these engines were ever built, and they were incredibly powerful. Reportedly, when German enemy agents reported on their power they were not believed. Other train cars are also on display, including a Forney Locomotive, a dining car, cabooses, and more.Since the museum has many different types of historical vehicles on display, you can also expect to find many other displays. You can find many antique cars, fire engines, carriages and wagons, aircraft, steam tractors, trolleys, and more. There are even collections of bicycles and tricycles, and motorcycles, too.Special exhibits are brought to the museum and then later rotated with another one. These exhibits are great collections from other museums. For the year 2010, the museum will be host to a Studebaker Exhibit (January through March), and a Timme Motorcycle Collection of 54 different models, which includes many great brands and models of the past.In the past, the museum has had displays of a 1934 Pierce Arrow, a 1927 Rolls Royce, a 1916 Detroit Electric, and a 1923 Hispano Suiza. There has also been a display of an 1811 Overland Stagecoach, a 1967 Amphicar, and many more.The museum also has some rather unique displays, as well, that are not vehicle related.

Denver,Denver's Red Rocks Amphitheatre Offers Acoustic Perfection in a Natural Setting,"Concert StageLocated just west of Denver in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Red Rocks Amphitheatre has been recognized for more than a century as a premiere performance venue. This geologically-formed natural amphitheatre is blessed with top-notch acoustics, providing an ideal site for concerts of any variety.Red Rocks Amphitheatre is one-of-a-kind and its excellent acoustics are a result of the two giant monoliths that surround the seating area. Dubbed the Ship Rock and the Creation Rock, the sandstone structures are taller than Niagara Falls, They first caught the eye of John Brisben Walker during the early years of the 20th century. Walker recognized the Red Rocks area, once called the Garden of Angels, as an acoustically perfect setting that would enhance any concert that took place there. He constructed a temporary platform and from 1906-1910 was responsible for the organization of many performances at the site.Walker's amphitheatre was purchased by the city of Denver in 1927 and was eventually enhanced and enlarged with the help of two Depression-era labor groups, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Work Projects Administration (WPA). The stage and seating area were designed by local architect Burnham Hoyt. He completed his plans in 1936 and five years later the amphitheatre held its dedicatory ceremony and performance.Word of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre's fine acoustics spread and the venue began attracting performers from around the world and audiences from throughout the region and beyond. In 1947, the amphitheatre began hosting an Easter Sunrise Service and continues to do so today. Also that year, the first official ""concert season'' was organized, offering performances throughout the late spring, summer, and early fall.Today, concert season at Red Rocks Amphitheatre still runs from May until September. The theater seats 9,450 people and all seats offer an excellent view of the stage.However, the Red Rocks area is more than just an amphitheatre. Locals and guests also visit Red Rocks to experience the natural beauty of the site. The 1.4-mile Trading Post Loop Trail takes hikers on a rugged trek through valleys, meadows, and past a variety of magnificent rock formations at about 6,300 feet above sea level. Several species of native trees and plants can be viewed along the trail and in the Red Rocks vicinity in general, as well as a variety of species of animals and birds. A Visitor Center provides trail maps and other pertinent information related to exploring the area around Red Rocks Amphitheatre."

Denver,"Coors Field in Denver, Colorado","Coors Field is the home of major league baseball team the Colorado Rockies, and is located at 2001 Blake Street, in Denver, Colorado. The stadium is named for the Coors Brewing Company, which purchased the naming rights to the park in 1995, prior to construction being completed. The Colorado Rockies played two seasons in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field in 1995.Groundbreaking for Coors Field began on October 16th, 1992, and the stadium was opened to the public on April 26th, 1995. The park was built at a cost of $300 million dollars, and was designed by the architecture firm of HOK Sport. Coors Field has a natural grass playing surface and a total seating capacity of 50,445 people, 63 luxury suites and 4,500 club seats as well.Before the first bricks were laid, designers knew the park would be ideal for hitting home runs because of high elevation and dry air. To rectify the situation, the outfield fences were placed farther away from home plate, giving Coors Field one of the largest outfields in baseball history. The field dimensions of the park are as follows; left field 347 feet, left center 390 feet, center field 415 feet, right center 375 feet, right field 350 feet and the backstop 56 feet.Previously, Coors Field had a reputation as being a home-run friendly baseball park, hence the nickname Coors Canaveral. The air in Denver tended to dry out the baseballs and made them harder, causing them to travel farther when hit. Additionally, curve balls will curve less in thinner air than at sea level; which leads to fewer strikeouts and harder work for the pitcher. In 2002, a humidor was added to the park for baseball storage, which has alleviated the problems of the past.Most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green; however seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple, which signifies the city's one mile elevation point. In other baseball stadiums home plate faces east or northeast, while the home plate at Coors Field faces north. Because of the location of home plate, during the game, sunlight shines on first base during sunset.Coors Field was designed with accessibility in mind; it is located near Interstate 25, has direct access to 20th Street and Park Avenue exits, and is near Union Station which provides light rail access for visitors. The stadium was originally designed to be a much smaller venue, however, because of record breaking crowds, right field upper deck and center field bleacher seats were added. The center field bleacher section is known by the informal name of ""the Rockpile''.Each year, Coors Field hosts some of the most exciting baseball games in the National Baseball League. The landscaped grounds of the stadium are designed to resemble the Colorado Rocky Mountains, complete with waterfalls, fountains and pine trees. Visitors are feted with breathtaking views of the Rocky Mountains, mild temperatures and a lively environment to enjoy a game of baseball."

Denver,"Denver Zoological Gardens in Denver, Colorado","The Denver Zoological Gardens was founded in 1896, when an orphaned American black bear cub was given to the mayor. The mayor gave the rambunctious cub to keeper of the City Park, Alexander J. Graham who began the zoo with the cub. Other animals at the zoo included native waterfowl at Duck Lake, antelope, prairie dogs and a flock of Chinese pheasants. A population of red squirrels was added to the zoo in 1905, and completely destroyed the bird population.  The squirrels were then trapped and released into the Denver Mountain Park.In 1906, Denver mayor Robert W. Spears decided to do away with the bars on the habitats and replace them with concrete rocks, waterfalls and trees. City landscape architect Saco DeBoer was hired to draw up plans for the renovation, and Victor H. Borcherdt was brought on to act as director of the zoo. Borcherdt was instrumental in the construction of the Bear Mountain exhibit, which he designed between the years of 1917-1918.The Bear Mountain exhibit stands 43 feet tall and 185 feet long and the cost of construction was approximately $50,000. The structure was constructed using dyed and textured concrete forms which were cast from Dinosaur Mountain in Morrison, Colorado. To enhance the natural appeal of the habitat, hidden moats replaced bars; native plants and a stream were also added. The Bear Mountain exhibit established the Denver Zoo as a leader among American Zoos.Using funds from the Works Project Administration, the zoo made one notable addition, Monkey Island which was constructed in 1937. During the following years, very little was done to modernize the zoo and it was in poor condition. However, with the election of Mayor Quigg Newton, Saco DeBoer was rehired to devise plans for the rebirth of the zoo. During the 1950's, the zoo overhauled Monkey Island, expanded and improved the grounds and exhibits and today is a world-class facility.The zoo has continued to grow and in recent years has added some very significant new exhibits. In 2005, Predator Ridge exhibit was constructed. The display is representative of the African Savannah and has the ability to rotate between different predators such as lions, hyenas and African wild dogs. Complete with overlapping scents, the exhibit provides environmental enrichment for the various animals.Opening in 2009, the Asian Tropics exhibit is the largest and most expensive addition yet. Constructed at a cost of $40 million, the exhibit houses Asian elephants and other larger animals, in an outdoor rotational habitat. The exhibit will also include Indian Rhinoceros, Malayan Tapirs, Black leopards, Muntjacs, Asian elephant cows and many other types of animals.The Denver Zoo is open 365 days a year and summer hours are from March 1st through November 1st, from 9 am until 5 pm, and winter hours are from November 2nd through February 28th, from 10 am until 4 pm. Parking at the facility is free of charge, the zoo is fully handicapped accessible and provides picnic and concessions areas located conveniently throughout the park."
Denver,"Elitch Gardens - Denver, Colorado - Family Theme and Amusement Park","Elitch Gardens is a family theme and amusement park located in Denver, Colorado. Formerly known as Six Flags Elitch Gardens, the park is currently owned by CNL Lifestyle Properties, as well as operated by PARC Management along with six other fun parks that were also formerly part of the Six Flags family. The park keeps to a seasonal schedule and is typically open to visitors from late in the month of April through Halloween.Elitch as it is today first came into being when it was acquired by CNL in April of 2007. At that time all Looney Tunes themes (typically associated with Six Flags) were removed and several new rides and attractions were gradually introduced to freshen up the park. These include the RipQurl water slide in 2007 and an interactive haunted house ride known as Ghost Blasters that was added in 2008. At this time, Elitch also began hosting a new summertime concert series that features big name recording artists such as Billy Ray Cyrus, Randy Travis, Smash Mouth, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.As is the case with many amusement parks, Elitch Gardens features a wide variety of different rides that are categorized according to intensity level. The most intense category - the thrill rides - features such attractions as the Tower of Doom drop ride, the Rainbow swing ride, the Mind Eraser monster coaster, and the Hollywood & Vine spin ride. Family rides include classics like the carousel, the Big Wheel giant ferris wheel, and the Tea Cups. The kiddie section largely consists of milder versions of other rides to be found elsewhere in the park. In addition to all of these, Elitch also includes water rides such as Disaster Canyon, a white water rafting adventure; and Shipwreck Falls, an exciting adventure ride that treats riders to a breath-taking plunge over a 50-foot waterfall into the tidal wave below.Elitch Gardens also features many different types of sit-down entertainment options appropriate for park goers of all ages.

The former Capital Children's Museum was founded in 1974 and located near Union Station. It was a leader in children's museums with close to 200,000 visitors annually. Visitors included children, parents, caregivers, and teachers.It was decided a new building for the Children's Museum would be needed. At this same time it was also thought that the name should be changed to include a farther reach than just the Capital, thus the name National was chosen. The Capital Children's Museum is no longer open as a new building is being created. For now the National Children's Museum will be making the rounds on a regional and national basis. In other words the museum has traveling exhibits, programs, partnerships with organizations, and outreach programs. It has been known as the Museum without Walls because all exhibits are currently moving around rather than housed in a DC location.The future of the Capital Children's Museum or rather the National Children's Museum will begin in 2013. The new location will be at Prince George's County's National Harbor. The building is taking $2 billion to create with 300 acres of land. The land includes waterfront development to help reform the banks of the Potomac as a gateway for kids and families to learn at the museum.Since the museum has such a long history in Washington DC is has been imperative to have a little space for some of the exhibits.

Washington District of Columbia,Library of Congress - District of Columbia - Historic Federal Library Is Alive with Knowledge and Arts on Capitol Hill,"The Library of Congress is the largest library in the world. It is also the oldest cultural institution maintained by the United States Government. As implied by its name, the Library is a dependency of the legislative branch of the federal government.Thousands of staff people work full time to maintain the collection of over 138 million books, manuscripts, maps and recordings in 470 languages that are housed in the library. They also work to carry out other functions in compliance with the different missions of each of the facilities' 7 main divisions that are mentioned below as well as other offices.The main divisions are: 1)the Congressional Research Office, which fulfills hundreds of thousands of research missions for Congress annually and provides more than a thousand written reports each year; 2) the Copyright Office, which registers and maintains creative copyrights for all territories within the national borders; 3) the Law Library, which provides easy access to Congress and the public to over 3 million volumes of law pertaining to nearly every existing jurisdiction in the world as well as from different time periods; 4) Library Services, which not only maintains, catalogues and provides access to the existing collection but also seeks to improve its quality and quantity while promoting American creativity; 5) the Office of Strategic Initiatives which directs planning and integrated follow up within the Library of Congress; 6) The Office of the Librarian which sets policy and is responsible for administration including Development, Public Affairs and Legal Counsel; and, 7) The Enabling Infrastructure that includes the Finance Office, Human Resources, etc.The Librarian of Congress and the Chief Operating Officer oversee the functioning of the library and sit on the Executive Committee of the Library of Congress, together with Chief Officers of other divisions listed above.The Library was first opened in 1800 within the Capitol Building. It was created in the same Act of Congress that moved the Capitol to Washington D.C.  The initial collection was burned when the British set fire to the Capitol in 1814. Shortly afterwards, Thomas Jefferson offered his collection of 6,487 books as a replacement.When the Library of Congress moved into its own Italian Renaissance- style building in 1897, the Thomas Jefferson Building (1st St. S.E., between Independence Ave. and East Capitol St.), it was considered the largest and safest library in the world.Today it fills three Capitol Hill Buildings in all. The buildings are: the original Jefferson building of 1897; the John Adams Building (2nd Street S.E., between Independence Ave. and East Capitol St.), which opened in 1938 and was named after the second President who signed the 1800 bill to create the library; and, the James Madison Memorial Building (101 Independence Ave. S.E.), named after the author or the Bill of Rights, which was completed in 1981. More than 50 American artists have painted and sculpted the decorations that are found adorning the interiors of these buildings.Public tours of the Library occur several times a day. Concerts, films, art exhibitions and lectures are also frequently scheduled within the majestically carved and adorned halls of the Library of Congress.The Jefferson and Madison Buildings offer spaces that are available for private event rental."
Washington District of Columbia,Lincoln Memorial - Washington D.C. - A Giant Monument to the 16th President Sits on the National Mall,"The Lincoln Memorial is found at the west end of the Reflecting Pool that stretches across the National Mall in West Potomac Park on the southern end of downtown Washington D.C.On passing through the two front columns into the building one comes face to face with the gargantuan image of the 16th President staring down from his seat. This President, Abraham Lincoln, is credited for ending slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation after the bloody civil war threatened to permanently split the Union in two.Henry Bacon modeled the structure on ancient Greek architectural style. The building itself is 190 feet long, nearly 100 feet high and 119 feet wide. It is constructed from Colorado Yule Marble and Indiana Limestone.The northern and southern halls of the monument, (which is maintained by the National Parks Service), contain carvings of Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and the Gettysburg Address.In the main hall sits the stoic sculpture of President Lincoln that stretching 19 feet into the air. The statue of the seated President is said to weigh 175 tons. The lifelike statue required four years of carving in order to be completed.Not long after Lincoln's death, the proposal for the Memorial was originally made. In 1867 the Lincoln Memorial Commission was appointed by Congress. However it was not until 1910 that Congress approved a 2 million dollar budget for the project in a bill signed into law in early 1911 by President Taft. In 1914 the work began. For a total cost of approximately 3 million dollars it was completed in 8 years. Since then, untold numbers of people have visited the monument, which is open from 8 AM until 11:45 PM throughout the year except on Christmas.While a series of steps climb up to the front entry, wheelchair access is available from below the building. Public restrooms are also located at this same secondary entry.The monument has been the backdrop for numerous public protests and speeches since it was built. Civil rights leaders and other Americans expressing free speech rights have sought to draw inspiration from a man who was arguably one of the nation's greatest elected leaders. In this respect it is most remembered as the site from where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his 1963 ""I have a dream'' speech.Aside from the two entry columns an additional 36 fluted columns stretch upward some 44 feet representing the 36 states that belonged to the Union at the time of Lincoln's assassination.While the Smithsonian Metro stop is the closest, various Metro stations are in walking distance including Faragut North and L'Enfant Plaza.The White stone building is illuminated at night, an hour when fewer tourists are about. Parking nearby is difficult at all hours of the day and at night, thus it is recommended to take the Metro."
